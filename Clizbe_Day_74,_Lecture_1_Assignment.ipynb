              "'HONOLULU (AP) — The University of Hawaii seeks additional funds for student mental health services, scholarships and other items in a new supplementary budget request, officials said. The Board of Regents approved the fiscal year 2020-2021 supplemental operating budget of about $28 million Thursday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The request will be submitted to the state Legislature and Democratic Gov. The university requested $2.6 million to hire 19 psychologists for the 10-campus system. The University of Hawaii Manoa has eight psychologists, the Hilo campus has three, and the West Oahu campus has 1.75 positions, while each community college has one position, said Allyson Tanouye, who coordinates mental health throughout the university system. \"The national standard is one mental health professional per 1,000 to 1,500 students,\" Tanouye said. \"If we add the 19 positions we will be up to one per 1,500. That\\'s how low we are\". The mental health funding would also expand programs to prevent suicide, reduce mental health stigma, provide peer education, and alert new students and parents to college transition challenges, officials said. The largest item in the supplemental budget is $17.7 million to expand the Hawaii Promise Program scholarship to four-year state institutions. The university has proposed a flat amount to cover tuition and fees of Hawaii residents qualifying for need-based federal Pell grants. \"This is looking to focus on the most needy students going to the four-year campuses,\" said Donald Straney, vice president for academic planning and policy. \"It would add Hawaii Promise on top of the Pell grants to cover the total tuition costs of students who are receiving those grants\". The request also covered staffing increases including positions for operations and maintenance, security, educational and cultural programming, and student mentors. Information from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com.NEW YORK (AP) — Go ahead and rinse your cranberries, potatoes and green beans. But food experts say don\\'t — repeat don\\'t — wash the turkey before popping it in the oven on Thanksgiving Day. They say that could spread the germs lurking on your turkey in the kitchen sink or nearby food. But it\\'s been a challenge trying to convince cooks to stop rinsing off raw poultry. \"If your mother did it and your grandmother did it, and suddenly the (government) says not to wash your turkey, you may take some time to adjust,\" said Drusilla Banks, who teaches food sanitation for the University of Illinois Extension. Germs that can make people sick are common in the guts of healthy poultry and are legally allowed to be on raw turkey and chicken. The assumption is that nobody eats their poultry rare, and that thorough cooking will kill the bacteria. So it\\'s possible that two common causes of food poisoning — salmonella and campylobacter — are on the turkey, said Mindy Brashears, a food safety official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The do-not-wash raw poultry advice from the USDA is relatively new and perhaps hasn\\'t caught on because it goes against the ingrained belief that washing makes things clean, said Banks. Participants in a food safety study offered their own rationale: \"If it\\'s still slimy — I\\'m not sure what that is. It just feels good to wash it,\" said one. Another said: \"My grandmother taught me that. She just said to wash all your food because there\\'s no telling where it\\'s been before it got in the pack\". Benjamin Chapman, a study author and food safety expert at North Carolina State University, said the instinct to wash raw poultry goes back at least decades when people relied more on visual cues to spot problems with poultry. TV chef Julia Child was among those who said washing chicken was \"just the safer thing to do\" before experts began advising against it. But food prep is a juggling act, and germs from poultry can be spread even if it\\'s not washed, especially when birds are removed from packaging. It\\'s why washing and sanitizing hands, utensils and surfaces are even more important. The USDA-funded study underscores that point. Researchers sprayed raw chicken with a harmless strain of E. coli and watched volunteer cooks at test kitchens. Among those who washed their raw chicken, about a quarter ended up spreading the bacteria to their lettuce. But even some of those who did not rinse the chicken got germs on the lettuce. There are other opportunities for germs to survive and thrive on turkeys: thawing and cooking. For thawing, experts say frozen birds shouldn\\'t be left out on counters since germs can start multiplying on the outer parts that defrost first. They instead recommend thawing in fridges, cold water or in microwaves. You can also cook a frozen turkey, but it will take a lot longer. And to ensure a bird is thoroughly cooked, they say to use a thermometer to check that the deepest and thickest parts of it have reached 165 degrees. Even after the meal is cooked, you aren\\'t out of the danger zone. To keep turkey and other leftovers safe, experts say they should be refrigerated after two hours.

The notice comes almost exactly one year after a similar outbreak led to a blanket warning about romaine. Officials urged Americans not to eat the leafy green if the label doesn\\'t say where it was grown. They also urged supermarkets and restaurants not to serve or sell the lettuce, unless they\\'re sure it was grown elsewhere. The warning applies to all types of romaine from the Salinas region, include whole heads, hearts and pre-cut salad mixes. \"We\\'re concerned this romaine could be in other products,\" said Laura Gieraltowski, lead investigator of the outbreak at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials said their investigation led to farms in Salinas and that they are looking for the source of E. coli tied to the illnesses. Salinas is a major growing region for romaine from around April to this time of year, when growing shifts south to Yuma, Arizona. After last year\\'s pre-Thanksgiving outbreak tied to romaine, the produce industry agreed to voluntarily label the lettuce with harvest regions. Health officials said that would make it easier to trace romaine and issue more specific public health warnings when outbreaks happen. Officials never identified exactly how romaine might have become contaminated in past outbreaks. But another outbreak in spring 2018 that sickened more than 200 people and killed five was traced to tainted irrigation water near a cattle lot. (E. coli is found in the feces of animals such as cows.) It\\'s not clear exactly why romaine keeps popping up in outbreaks, but food safety experts note the popularity of romaine lettuce and the difficulty of eliminating risk for produce grown in open fields and eaten raw. Industry groups noted that they tightened safety measures following last year\\'s outbreaks, including expanding buffer zones between growing fields and livestock. \"It\\'s very, very disturbing. Very frustrating all around,\" said Trevor Suslow of the Produce Marketing Association. The CDC says 40 people have been reported sick so far in 16 states. The most recent reported illness started on Nov. 10. The agency says it\\'s the same E. coli strain tied to previous outbreaks, including the one from last Thanksgiving. The CDC\\'s Gieraltowski said that suggests there\\'s a persisting contamination source in the environment.

On some campuses, the number of students seeking treatment has nearly doubled over the last five years while overall enrollment has remained relatively flat. The increase has been tied to reduced stigma around mental health, along with rising rates of depression and other disorders. Universities have expanded their mental health clinics, but the growth is often slow, and demand keeps surging. Long waits have provoked protests at schools from Maryland to California, in some cases following student suicides. Meanwhile, campus counseling centers grapple with low morale and high burnout as staff members face increasingly heavy workloads. \"It\\'s an incredible struggle, to be honest,\" said Jamie Davidson, associate vice president for student wellness at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which has 11 licensed counselors for 30,000 students. \"It\\'s stressful on our staff and our resources. We\\'ve increased it, but you\\'re never going to talk to anyone in the mental health field who tells you we have sufficient resources\". The Associated Press requested five years of data from the largest public university in each state. A total of 39 provided annual statistics from their counseling clinics or health centers. The remaining 11 said they did not have complete records or had not provided records five months after they were requested. The data shows that most universities are working to scale up their services, but many are far outpaced by demand. Since 2014, the number of students receiving mental health treatment at those schools has grown by 35%, while total enrollment grew just 5%. By last year, nearly 1 in 10 students were coming for help, but the number of licensed counselors changed little, from an average of 16 to 19 over five years. On some campuses, that amounts to one counselor for every 4,000 students, including at Utah Valley University. An industry accrediting group suggests a minimum of one counselor per 1,500 students, but few of the 39 universities met that benchmark. When Ashtyn Aure checked in at the mental health clinic at Utah Valley last year, she was suffering anxiety attacks and had not slept for days. Her mind kept returning to past traumas. When she asked to see a counselor, a staff member told her the wait list stretched for months. She left without getting help. \"I was so obviously distressed, and that was the place I was supposed to go. What do you do after that? Do you go to the hospital? Do you phone a friend?\" said Aure, 25, who graduated this year. Ultimately, she turned to her church, which helped her find therapy at an outside clinic. \"If it wasn\\'t for that,\" she said, \"I don\\'t know\". Officials at Utah Valley said they are working to avoid such cases. If staff know a student is in crisis, they said, a counselor can see that person in a matter of minutes. But staff members have only a few moments to make an assessment. \"Unfortunately, stories like this are not that uncommon,\" said Dr. William Erb, senior director of student health services at Utah Valley. \"We train, review and revise these procedures so that situations like this can be avoided as much as possible\". At most universities, students contemplating suicide or otherwise in crisis are offered help right away. Others are asked to schedule an appointment. For cases that are not urgent, the wait can range from hours to months, depending on the time of year and the design of the clinic. Many schools that provided data to the AP said it takes weeks to get an initial appointment. At Utah Valley, students waited an average of more than four weeks last year. At the University of Washington at Seattle, it was three weeks. During busy times at Louisiana State, wait times stretched to four or five weeks. Some other schools have adopted a model that provides screenings the same day students ask for help, but it can take weeks to get further treatment. To some students, waiting is just an inconvenience. But it raises the risk that some young people will forgo help entirely, potentially allowing their problems to snowball. Students at Brigham Young University drew attention to delays last year after a student took her own life on campus. Days after the suicide, an anonymous letter was posted at the counseling center describing the dilemma some students face. \"I have a therapist on campus, and he is wonderful and well qualified. But I only see him once a month. Because he has too many clients to see in one week,\" the letter said. \"It is the story of many of us barely getting by here at BYU. If I died would anything change?\". Students at the University of Maryland called for change last year after some on campus said they had to wait 30 days or more for an initial appointment. Organizers called the campaign \"30 Days Too Late\". \"We quickly realized that there were a lot of people on campus who believed in what we were doing and had had their own experiences,\" said Garrett Mogge, a junior who helped organize the effort. \"Thirty days can be a long time. And once you get there, it\\'s too late for some people\". Officials at the University of Maryland said the campaign showed there was a need to raise awareness about same-day crisis services available on campus. The school also has hired additional counselors since the campaign began. Other schools that have received student petitions to improve counseling include Michigan State, Louisiana State, Columbia and Cornell universities. For cases that are not urgent, some argue that waiting isn\\'t necessarily bad — and could even lead to better outcomes. A recent study found greater reductions in anxiety and depression at clinics that focus on providing students counseling at regular intervals, a system that might mean waiting for a therapist\\'s caseload to open. That practice was compared with clinics that offer quick initial help but cannot always provide routine follow-up treatment. The study by Pennsylvania State University\\'s Center for Collegiate Mental Health found that prioritizing access over treatment \"may have significant negative consequences for students in need\". The rising demand for campus mental health care has been attributed to an array of factors. Stigma around the issue has faded, encouraging more students to get help. Disorders that once prevented students from going to college are no longer seen as a barrier. Some people believe social media fuels anxiety, while others say today\\'s students simply have more trouble coping with stress. Mass shootings, and the fear they spread, have also been suggested as a factor. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, saw an increase in demand following a 2017 shooting at a nearby county music festival that left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded. \"That really increased the number of students we were seeing,\" said Davidson, the head of student wellness. The school later hired a trauma specialist and added a student mental health fee to hire more counselors, among other measures to reduce wait times. For years, national surveys have found rising rates of anxiety and depression among college students. Most colleges that provided data to the AP said those conditions, and stress, were the most common complaints. Some schools also have seen more students struggling with thoughts of suicide. The shifting landscape has spurred many universities to rethink how they provide help, including offering more short-term treatment options. More students are being steered to group therapy or anxiety workshops. Counseling centers offer yoga, and many train students to counsel one another. \"We\\'re reframing what mental health looks like at a school. It\\'s not necessarily 10 therapists sitting in offices,\" said Erb, the student health director at Utah Valley. Rising demand has also opened doors for businesses promising solutions. Some schools have signed on with companies that provide therapy over the phone or through video chats. Others urge students to try smartphone apps. But some say the changes will help little if clinics remain understaffed. Counselors at some California State University campuses are pressing the system to hire more staff even as it expands peer counseling programs and wellness workshops. A faculty union is lobbying to reach a ratio of one counselor for every 1,500 students. The system estimates it has one for every 2,700 students. \"Some students come in, and they can be seen maybe once every five or six weeks. They are shocked, because that\\'s not what they\\'re used to out in the real world,\" said Martha Cuan, a counselor at Stanislaus State University, one of the system\\'s 23 campuses. A state bill requiring the system to set a goal to meet the lower ratio failed to gain traction in the state Legislature this year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it next year. Other states tackling the issue include Illinois, which in August approved a law telling public universities to aim for one counselor per 1,250 students. For many schools, finding the money to add counselors is a challenge. Many campus clinics don\\'t charge students for services and generate little or no revenue. A 2016 bill in Congress proposed new grants for university counseling, but it never advanced to a vote. Some schools are adding new campus fees to hire counselors or are subsidizing clinics through athletics revenue, as the University of Texas recently did. Overall, the AP analysis found that campus counseling budgets have increased by about 25% over the last five years, but levels vary widely, from more than $200 per student at some campuses to less than $40 at others. The way students feel about campus mental health services is mixed, according to a recent poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Among adults ages 18 through 29 who have pursued higher education, about a third said colleges do a good job handling mental health needs, while about as many said they think schools do a bad job. Another 3 in 10 said it\\'s neither good nor bad. Most university presidents say mental health is a growing concern, but they lack the tools to address it, according to a separate survey of school chiefs by the American Council on Education. Given unlimited funding, the survey found, most presidents said they would first hire more mental health staff. On any campus, the greatest fear is that a student in dire need could fall through the cracks. Mike and Kim Predmore believe that\\'s what happened to their son, Chris, who was struggling as a freshman at Illinois State University in 2014. He had just been through a bad breakup. He didn\\'t make the soccer team. He was stressed about school and wasn\\'t sleeping. One night, he texted a friend and talked about suicide. His family persuaded him to visit the campus counseling center for help. At an initial screening, Chris Predmore told a counselor he was not thinking about suicide but wanted to try therapy, according to notes from the visit. He was told that there was a wait on campus and that he should explore nearby clinics with his parents. He never did. Two days later, he took his own life. His parents have since become regulars at a support group for families of suicide victims. Three other couples in the group also lost children who were in college. The Predmores wonder why there aren\\'t more counselors and why schools can\\'t do more. Often, they just wonder what might have been. \"I think if they would have said, \\'Yeah, we\\'re going to get you into counseling,\\' I don\\'t think he\\'d be dead,\" Kim Predmore said. \"I don\\'t know. I\\'ll never know. But I think he would have been able to hang on\". Collin Binkley can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley.BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Health officials say a second person in Louisiana has died of a vaping-related lung injury. It\\'s the second such death in the state this week. The state\\'s first one was reported Monday, and the second Friday. The Louisiana Department of Health says on its website that 32 people in Louisiana have been diagnosed with the ailment since August. Patients have ranged in age from 17 to 71. Investigators with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention haven\\'t found a single device, ingredient or additive in common among nearly 2,300 illnesses reported nationwide since March. Elements they\\'re investigating include a thickener used in THC vapes. The state agency says 15 patients reported smoking a combination of nicotine and THC. The department is advising people against vaping.ANTELOPE ISLAND, Utah (AP) — Utah state wildlife officials gathered mule deer on Antelope Island this week and flew them by helicopter to biologists studying the health of the herd. About 50 deer were flown this week, typically two or three at a time dangling below the aircraft in orange bags, the Standard-Examiner reported. The blindfolded and restrained deer were taken to the island\\'s Fielding Garr Ranch, where biologists and other Utah Division of Wildlife Resources staffers checked various aspects of each animal\\'s health, including hind feet, body length and body fat. \"The fat helps us understand how well they\\'re going into winter,\" said Eric Anderson, district wildlife biologist over the northern region with DWR. \"For mule deer, their survival depends highly on how much fat they can put on during the summer, so that gives us an indication of how well. the summer has been for them coming into winter\". They also draw blood, give the animals shots such as vitamin D and outfit them with tracking collars to track migration patterns, Anderson said. The goal is to make sure the herd is at a healthy size, given vegetation conditions and deer migration on and off the state park located on the Great Salt Lake, Anderson said. There are 400 to 500 deer living on the island located north of Salt Lake City and known for its herd of bison. They\\'re caught by contractor who shoots a net out of a gun from a helicopter. Workers quickly restrain the entangled animal to reduce its stress. They are monitored throughout the health-assessment process. If their temperature rises too high, an indication of stress, the team will spray it down with an alcohol-water solution or cover the deer with a towel soaked in ice water to cool it down. Occasionally a deer is injured during the capture process, including one buck who lost several teeth either in the capture or an unrelated fight with another buck during mating season. Even so, Anderson said the helicopters remain the safest method for both animals and people. That buck was treated by a veterinarian, as are animals with less serious injuries such as scrapes and scratches. Similar projects are also done to monitor deer, elk, bison and bighorn sheep populations, Anderson said. \"It\\'s a pretty intense effort statewide to monitor our populations and look at migration, and that helps us to better be stewards of the wildlife for the citizens of Utah,\" Anderson said.BANGOR, Maine (AP) — Senators from Maine and New Hampshire are working on an effort to make new diabetes management technologies available to more senior citizens. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen say in a statement that a bill they have introduced would create a task force within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to \"examine and address barriers that seniors face in accessing the latest diabetes management technologies\". Collins says seniors have informed her that when they transition to Medicare, they often learn that technologies they\\'ve long relied on aren\\'t covered. Shaheen says access to innovation about diabetes management\\'s especially important in an era when many patients must cope with rising insulin costs. The proposal also seeks to cut other impediments that prevent patients from accessing diabetes technologies.ARLINGTON, Neb. (AP) — Classes in Arlington, about 35 miles northwest of Omaha, have been cancelled because of a suspected outbreak of norovirus. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the decision saw classes for the district\\'s more than 600 students in kindergarten through 12th grade canceled on Friday. Classes are set to resume Monday, after school buildings are deep-cleaned and sanitized over the weekend. School officials made the decision to cancel classes after 112 students — most of them in elementary school — became ill. Norovirus is a highly contagious bug that causes diarrhea, vomiting and other symptoms and can spread quickly in public places. The news came after the Grand Junction school district in western Colorado announced it was shutting down through Thanksgiving week because of a norovirus outbreak. Information from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com.DANVILLE, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire health officials say a kitten taken to an animal rescue organization tested positive for rabies. Health officials say the kitten was found in Danville and brought to the Salem Animal Rescue League on Nov. 13. It began showing symptoms of rabies Tuesday and tested positive for the virus Thursday. The Health Department said Friday it\\'s identified all people who had direct physical contact with the kitten and is contacting them to assess their potential risk for exposure to the rabies virus. The kitten was only available to visitors on Nov. 14. Authorities say the kitten lived outdoors in the area of Main Street between Cobblers Ridge and Hersey Road in Danville. There are believed to be other outdoor cats and kittens there that may be at risk for having rabies. The town\\'s animal control officer is investigating.SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris wants to double the number of mental health treatment beds available across the country and increase access to virtual mental health counseling. Harris will roll out her mental health platform Monday at a South Carolina event with radio host Charlamagne Tha God, who has spoken about his own mental health struggles. Much of Harris\\' plan includes elements she\\'s teased on the campaign trail, where she frequently says Americans need to put just as much attention on health from the \"neck up\" as from the neck down. \"Instead of letting people silently suffer from depression, from drug addiction, from suicidal thoughts, we need to bring this out of the shadow and discuss it and put resources into it, get rid of the stigma,\" the senator from California told a crowd in Iowa this month. Harris\\' plan, released by the campaign, lists South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, all early voting states, as priority states for increasing mental health treatment beds. It also lists Michigan, a key swing state. South Carolina, where Harris will roll out the plan, is one of the worst states for access to mental health care, according to rankings by the nonprofit organization Mental Health America. On the trail, Harris, who launched her 2020 campaign in January, has stated the need to put serious resources into mental health treatment. But her plan does not include price tags or details on what it would cost to double the number of treatment beds or cover her other proposals. It does propose a $100 million fund for Native American communities to address mental health. Spokesman Ian Sams did not respond to questions about the plan\\'s costs. Beyond doubling treatment beds, Harris proposes doubling research dollars for the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to focus on post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and other drivers of mental illness. She would direct federal agencies focused on mental health to collect better data on people facing mental illness and reclassify certain disorders, such as schizophrenia, to improve access to treatment. Harris also has proposed a loan forgiveness program for mental health workers who go to areas facing provider shortages. She introduced similar legislation last year as well as a bill to increase telemedicine. The plan goes hand in hand with Harris\\' proposed expansion of Medicare. Health care is a major flashpoint in the Democratic primary contest, and Harris has tried to strike a middle ground by proposing a \"Medicare for All\" system that preserves a role for private insurers.

Their names are plastered on buildings and headlines across France, calling attention to their shared fate: Each was killed, allegedly by a current or former partner this year. More than 130 women have died from domestic violence this year alone in France, according to activists who track the deaths. European Union studies show France has a higher rate of domestic violence than most of its European peers. And frustrated activists have drawn national attention to a problem President Emmanuel Macron has called \"France\\'s shame\". Under cover of night, activists have glued posters with the names of the dead and calls to action to French city walls. \"Complaints ignored, women killed,\" read the black block letters on one such sign. They have also posted anti-violence slogans, tagged with Macron\\'s name. By the hundreds, women have walked silently through city streets after each new death. Two years after Macron made a campaign pledge to tackle the problem, his centrist French government has begun to act. A Justice Ministry report released earlier this month acknowledged authorities\\' systematic failure to intervene to prevent domestic violence slayings. On Monday, the government will announce measures that are expected to include seizing firearms from people suspected of domestic violence, prioritizing police training and formally recognizing \"psychological violence\" as a form of domestic violence. Women are not the only victims of domestic violence, but French officials say they make up the vast majority. Lawyers and victims\\' advocates say women are too often disbelieved or turned away by French law enforcement. But they\\'re encouraged by the new national conversation, which they say marks a departure from decades of denial. \"In France, we always have the impression that we are perfect,\" activist Caroline de Haas told The Associated Press. A 2014 EU survey of 42,000 women across all 28 member states found that 26% of French women respondents said they been abused by a partner since age 15, either physically or sexually. That\\'s below the global average of 30%, according to UN Women. But it\\'s 4 percentage points above the EU average and the sixth highest among EU countries. Half that number reported experiencing such abuse in Spain, which implemented a series of legal and educational measures in 2004 that slashed its domestic violence rates. Conversations about domestic violence have also ratcheted up in neighboring Germany, where activists are demanding that the term \"femicide\" be used to describe such killings. In France, victims and advocates say government action is overdue — and that more training is needed for police who are often ill-prepared to protect women in danger. Police inaction made national headlines in France after Macron visited a hotline call center in September and listened in on a call with a 57-year-old woman whose husband had threatened to kill her. He heard a police officer on the other end tell the woman he couldn\\'t help her. The hotline operator told Macron that such responses weren\\'t unusual. Police officers across Europe often dismiss domestic violence as a private matter and fail to intervene at crucial moments, an EU study found this year. But France is particularly bad, said EU researcher Albin Dearing, who led a study this year that examined domestic violence in seven European countries, including France. \"When it comes to violence against women, it showed actually that police do very little to protect women who turn to them for protection,\" he said. It can take between three weeks and two months for authorities to act on a complaint, leaving the victim \"in a very fragile situation,\" according to Frederique Martz, who runs anti-domestic violence organization Women Safe. The Justice Ministry report this month found that 41% of \"conjugal homicide\" victims studied had previously reported incidents of domestic violence, and 80% of complaints sent to prosecutors went uninvestigated. \"Our system doesn\\'t work to protect women,\" Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told French TV channel LCI after another French woman was allegedly killed by her husband in Alsace last week. But Maj. Fabienne Boulard of the national police said many officers respond appropriately to reports of domestic violence. Those who don\\'t — the ones who react \"clumsily\" or ask the wrong questions — usually don\\'t mean harm, she added; they just don\\'t recognize domestic violence or know how to intervene. This is particularly true when women receive threats but not yet physical blows, victims say. Officers \"absorb this violence into the category of violence between a couple that is going through a difficult period,\" said one woman whose ex-husband repeatedly threatened her and their children. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. The woman divorced him after years of what she describes as psychological abuse that left her \"terrified to cross him\". His threats only grew worse from there, she said. She filed multiple complaints, but she said police officers suggested she didn\\'t seem like a victim or wasn\\'t able to prove that she was in danger. Earlier this month, Boulard led the first supplementary training on domestic violence for police in the Paris suburb of Les Mureaux. She emphasized to the eight officers there that among victims, \"shame is an extremely strong feeling\". Participants traded stories of issues they had encountered: the surge in complaints on Sundays, the woman who retracts her complaint, the partner who insists everything is fine. \"We can\\'t do anything,\" one female police officer complained. Boulard told The AP that the three-hour session aimed to help officers understand the pressures that victims face and \"why the victim is not what they imagined, why sometimes they don\\'t correspond with the criteria they expect to see\". Trainings like Boulard\\'s take place in some parts of France, but regional authorities can decide whether to hold them. Activists hope they\\'ll become routine. \"A year or two ago, no one used the word \\'femicide\\' apart from feminist organizations,\" Haas said. \"There is very much a change in public consciousness\".HOWELL, Mich. (AP) — State regulators say follow-up tests near a factory in Livingston County show low levels of a chemical linked to cancer. The health department says emissions at Diamond Chrome Plating in Howell reveal TCE levels below \"health screening values\". TCE stands for trichloroethylene, which is used to remove grease from metal parts. Diamond Chrome turned off the degreaser this week. Earlier tests had revealed TCE levels that were considered a health hazard. A public meeting was held Thursday night. Hugh McDiarmid Jr. of the Michigan Department of Environment says the \"recent results are encouraging\". Elevated levels of TCE can cause birth defects and raise the risk of kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts lawmakers passed a groundbreaking ban Thursday on the sale of flavored tobacco and vaping products, including menthol cigarettes. The bill would also place a 75% excise tax on vaping products and require health insurers, including the state\\'s Medicaid program, to cover tobacco cessation counseling. \"This nation-leading step will save lives,\" Democratic House Speaker Robert DeLeo said. The ban was passed by the Senate early Thursday before the legislature broke for a holiday recess. It had earlier been passed by the state House of Representatives and now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Baker hasn\\'t indicated whether or when he will sign the ban, but its chances are good. In September, he had declared a public health emergency and ordered a temporary ban on the sale of vaping products. The legislation would immediately ban the sale of flavored vaping products and would outlaw sales of menthol cigarettes starting June 1, 2020. The legislation responds to growing concern about the health effects of vaping products, including deaths. It is the first such statewide legislation in the country, according to Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. \"This legislation is a critical step to help end the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic and stop tobacco companies from using appealing flavors to lure kids into a lifetime of addiction,\" he said in a written statement. \"It would make Massachusetts the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco products\". The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also called it first-in-the-nation legislation. \"More than 80% of teens who have ever used a tobacco product started with a flavored product, and the tobacco industry knows this,\" the organization said in an emailed statement. Studies have shown menthol cigarettes are consumed disproportionately by young people and minorities, and anti-tobacco groups and health experts have argued menthol has been marketed in particular to African Americans. A major retailers\\' organization called the legislation disappointing. \"We are disappointed the legislature supports bills that disproportionately impact communities of color and have disastrous implications for public health, public safety, state tax revenue and jobs in the Commonwealth,\" Jonathan Shaer, president of the New England Convenience Store Owners and Energy Marketers Association said in a statement. He called menthol and mint tobacco as \"legal, adult products that aren\\'t associated with youth overuse\".YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) — Health officials say a hepatitis A outbreak in Yakima County now involves 11 cases. The Yakima Health District said Thursday that the cases involve people experiencing homelessness or those who use illicit drugs. The health district announced the outbreak Nov. 7, when five cases were confirmed in Yakima County. Since then, various local agencies have done outreach and vaccinated 74 people. The virus affects the liver and spreads through contaminated feces. It causes symptoms like fever, dark urine, yellow-tinged skin or eyes, fatigue and gastric issues. People pass it along by eating or drinking tainted food or water, or through sex. On July 30, the Washington State Department of Health announced a multi-county hepatitis A outbreak. Through genetic testing, it was found that the Yakima County hepatitis A strain that is being observed is related to the hepatitis A outbreak in Spokane.The next time you get sick, your care may involve a form of the technology people use to navigate road trips or pick the right vacuum cleaner online. Artificial intelligence is spreading into health care, often as software or a computer program capable of learning from large amounts of data and making predictions to guide care or help patients. It already detects an eye disease tied to diabetes and does other behind-the-scenes work like helping doctors interpret MRI scans and other imaging tests for some forms of cancer. Now, parts of the health system are starting to use it directly with patients. During some clinic and telemedicine appointments, AI-powered software asks patients initial questions about their symptoms that physicians or nurses normally pose. And an AI program featuring a talking image of the Greek philosopher Aristotle is starting to help University of Southern California students cope with stress. Researchers say this push into medicine is at an early stage, but they expect the technology to grow by helping people stay healthy, assisting doctors with tasks and doing more behind-the-scenes work. They also think patients will get used to AI in their care just like they\\'ve gotten accustomed to using the technology when they travel or shop. But they say there are limits. Even the most advanced software has yet to master important parts of care like a doctor\\'s ability to feel compassion or use common sense. \"Our mission isn\\'t to replace human beings where only human beings can do the job,\" said University of Southern California research professor Albert Rizzo. Rizzo and his team have been working on a program that uses AI and a virtual reality character named \"Ellie\" that was originally designed to determine whether veterans returning from a deployment might need therapy. Ellie appears on computer monitors and leads a person through initial questions. Ellie makes eye contact, nods and uses hand gestures like a human therapist. It even pauses if the person gives a short answer, to push them to say more. \"After the first or second question, you kind of forget that it\\'s a robot,\" said Cheyenne Quilter, a West Point cadet helping to test the program. Ellie does not diagnose or treat. Instead, human therapists used recordings of its sessions to help determine what the patient might need. \"This is not AI trying to be your therapist,\" said another researcher, Gale Lucas. \"This is AI trying to predict who is most likely to be suffering\". The team that developed Ellie also has put together a newer AI-based program to help students manage stress and stay healthy. Ask Ari is making its debut at USC this semester to give students easy access to advice on dealing with loneliness, getting better sleep or handling other complications that crop up in college life. Ari does not replace a therapist, but its designers say it will connect students through their phones or laptops to reliable help whenever they need it. USC senior Jason Lewis didn\\'t think the program would have much for him when he helped test it because he wasn\\'t seeking counseling. But he found that Ari covered many topics he could relate to, including information on how social media affects people. \"Everybody thinks they are alone in their thoughts and problems,\" he said. \"Ari definitely counters that isolation\". Aside from addressing mental health needs, artificial intelligence also is at work in more common forms of medicine. The tech company AdviNOW Medical and 98point6, which provides treatment through secure text messaging, both use artificial intelligence to question patients at the beginning of an appointment. AdviNOW CEO James Bates said their AI program decides what questions to ask and what information it needs. It passes that information and a suggested diagnosis to a physician who then treats the patient remotely through telemedicine. The company currently uses the technology in a handful of Safeway and Albertsons grocery store clinics in Arizona and Idaho. But it expects to expand to about 1,000 clinics by the end of next year. Eventually, the company wants to have AI diagnose and treat some minor illnesses, Bates said. Researchers say much of AI\\'s potential for medicine lies in what it can do behind the scenes by examining large amounts of data or images to spot problems or predict how a disease will develop, sometimes quicker than a doctor. Future uses might include programs like one that hospitals currently use to tell doctors which patients are more likely to get sepsis, said Darren Dworkin, chief information officer at California\\'s Cedars-Sinai medical center. Those warnings can help doctors prevent the deadly illness or treat it quickly. \"It\\'s basically that little tap on the shoulder that we all want to get of, \\'Hey, perhaps you should look over here,\\'\" Dworkin said. Dr. Eric Topol predicts in his book \"Deep Medicine\" that artificial intelligence will change medicine, in part by freeing doctors to spend more time with patients. But he also notes that the technology will not take over care. Even the most advanced program cannot replicate empathy, Topol said. Patients stick to their treatment and prescriptions more and do better if they know their doctor is pulling for them. Artificial intelligence also can\\'t process everything a doctor considers when deciding on treatment, noted Harvard Medical School\\'s Dr. Isaac Kohane. That might include a patient\\'s tolerance for pain or the desire to live a few more months to attend a child\\'s wedding or graduation. \"Good doctors are the ones who understand us and our goals as human beings,\" he said.

Dr. Mike Ryan, who directs the U.N. health agency\\'s Ebola response, said there were only seven new cases last week. But he told reporters the near doubling of \"security incidents\" is jeopardizing attempts to end the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history. Officials have made progress in recent months but \"if security deteriorates in the region, we could work our way to a very bad situation,\" he said. Multiple rebel groups are active in the region. More than 40 civilians have been killed in the last two weeks, he said. More than 3,100 cases have been confirmed in this outbreak including more than 2,100 deaths. Ryan also said WHO understands all the chains of Ebola transmission in this outbreak except one, a high-risk death of a moto-bike driver who went to three health centers before being identified as a possible Ebola case. He died in the community and about 360 people were thought to have been exposed to him when he was highly infectious. Only about a third have been followed. \"At this stage of the outbreak, one case matters,\" Ryan said, adding that one worrisome case is enough to spark new transmission chains. \"That means the virus will get ahead of us again\". Since the Ebola outbreak was declared in August 2018, the response has been repeatedly hampered by attacks on health workers and Ebola clinics. Some assaults are believed to be financially motivated, as millions of dollars have been donated to help stem the virus\\' spread. When violence has forced the suspension of Ebola response efforts in areas like Beni and Butembo, health officials have seen a spike in the outbreak, Ryan said. He said response teams often have used police escorts or employed guards at Ebola clinics, explaining that there are \"difficult choices\" in an insecure environment. Other aid organizations have warned that linking armed escorts to a health response could worsen relations with an already wary community where Ebola had never been reported before.LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) — Vape shop owners in Washington state have raised concerns that a statewide ban on flavored vaping products resulted in a loss of business for most companies. Longview Daily News reports that two Cowlitz County stores are changing the way they do business to avoid closing down including replacing vaping products with cannabidiol health and beauty products. Longview and Kelso Viper Vapor stores manager Marshall Brock says they had two options to close or rebrand after the 120-day state ban was enacted Oct. 9. Brock says he chose the latter to survive. Vape D Lish owner Allan Kettle estimates a third of vapor-only stores have closed. Kettle says one of his stores is scheduled to close Saturday. State officials say the ban is intended to combat an increase in vaping-related illness. Information from: The Daily News, http://www.tdn.com.NASHVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Health officials say a barbeque restaurant in North Carolina may have sickened about a dozen people with salmonella. A press release from the Nash County Health Department says the operating permit for Doug Saul\\'s Bar-B-Que & Seafood in Nashville was suspended Friday. The statement says 14 cases of salmonella have been identified, and 10 people had visited the restaurant before they got sick. The restaurant said in a Facebook post that this is its first incident in 42 years of business. It says workers would begin sanitizing the building Monday. The health department swabbed multiple locations in the kitchen which returned several cultures positive for salmonella. The statement says salmonella is an organism that may cause fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) — The Michigan Department of Corrections has been hit with a class-action lawsuit on behalf of inmates who say they\\'ve been overwhelmed by chronic mold and other unsanitary conditions at the state\\'s only prison for women. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Detroit federal court, says the Huron Valley prison in Washtenaw County is \"operating under a state of degradation, filth and inhumanity\". Lawyers say women have suffered health problems because of mold and their complaints have gone unheeded. Spokesman Chris Gautz says the Corrections Department \"disagrees with the claims\". He declined further comment. Paula Bailey says exposure to mold has given her a rash, scars and respiratory problems. Another prisoner, Krystal Clark, says she suffers from chronic coughing and wears a mask when visiting with people.SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico\\'s health department says death rates in the state from chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer and stroke declined last year, but rates of suicide, homicide and unintentional injuries were up. The latest numbers are outlined in the state\\'s highlights of vital statistics for 2018. Deaths from flu and pneumonia also rose in 2018 from the previous year. Life expectancy at birth for people in New Mexico in 2018 was 78.1 years, a slight decrease from 78.2 in the prior year. Life expectancy declined for males from 75.3 to 74.9, while life expectancy for females increased from 81.2 to 81.5 years. The birth rate in the state continued to decline to a record low of 11 births per 1,000 people.ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Amazon has pulled more than a dozen skin-lightening products with dangerous levels of mercury off its website after Minnesota public-health and environmental activists raised concerns. The company\\'s change came after two groups, the BeautyWell Project and the state branch of the Sierra Club, delivered a petition on Wednesday with over 23,000 signatures to Amazon\\'s fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota Public Radio News reported. \"For a large retail company selling toxic products to individuals of color, I think it\\'s so wrong. And these are illegal products,\" said Amira Adawe, founder of the BeautyWell Project, who has been educating women on the hazards of creams intended to lighten their skin for about eight years. Amazon spokeswoman Cecilia Fan said sellers who use their site must follow the proper guidelines. \"And those who don\\'t will be subject to action, including potential removal of their account. The products in question are no longer available,\" she said in an emailed statement Friday. Fan also pointed out the company\\'s policy that bans suppliers from selling hazardous products, including ones containing mercury. On the same day of delivering the petition, the organizations also took out a full-page ad in a local newspaper demanding that the Seattle-based company stop selling toxic skin-lightening creams. The ad had three words in bold print: \"Dangerous, racist, and illegal\". Many such creams remain popular among some communities of color despite containing mercury. Adawe, who has worked on this issue for years locally, is now focused on targeting the retail giants. She collaborated with the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group, in addition to the Mercury Policy Project to examine the skin-lightening creams sold on the Amazon site. Out of the 24 that were tested, 15 showed high levels of mercury. Such products are not heavily regulated despite having illegal toxins in them, said Mary Blitzer of the local Sierra Club branch. Adawe said in addition to public health concerns, \"it\\'s a racial thing that keeps encouraging that people should change their skin color, and we don\\'t want to see that\". She added that the ultimate test is whether the products remain off Amazon\\'s site for good. As of Thursday evening, all but one of the 15 products appeared to be removed from the site.LONDON (AP) — Four African countries have reported new cases of polio linked to the oral vaccine, as global health numbers show there are now more children being paralyzed by viruses originating in vaccines than in the wild. In a report late last week, the World Health Organization and partners noted nine new polio cases caused by the vaccine in Nigeria, Congo, Central African Republic and Angola. Seven countries elsewhere in Africa have similar outbreaks and cases have been reported in Asia. Of the two countries where polio remains endemic, Afghanistan and Pakistan, vaccine-linked cases have been identified in Pakistan. In rare cases, the live virus in oral polio vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. All the current vaccine-derived polio cases have been sparked by a Type 2 virus contained in the vaccine. Type 2 wild virus was eliminated years ago. Polio is a highly infectious disease that spreads in contaminated water or food and usually strikes children under 5. About one in 200 infections results in paralysis. Among those, a small percentage die when their breathing muscles are crippled. Donors last week pledged $2.6 billion to combat polio as part of an eradication initiative that began in 1988 and hoped to wipe out polio by 2000. Since then, numerous such deadlines have been missed. To eradicate polio, more than 95% of a population needs to be immunized. WHO and partners have long relied on oral polio vaccines because they are cheap and can be easily administered, requiring only two drops per dose. Western countries use a more expensive injectable polio vaccine that contains an inactivated virus incapable of causing polio. The Independent Monitoring Board, a group set up by WHO to assess polio eradication, warned in a report this month that vaccine-derived polio virus is \"spreading uncontrolled in West Africa, bursting geographical boundaries and raising fundamental questions and challenges for the whole eradication process\". The group said officials were already \"failing badly\" to meet a recently approved polio goal of stopping all vaccine-derived outbreaks within 120 days of detection. It described the initial attitude of WHO and its partners to stopping such vaccine-linked polio cases as \"relaxed\" and said \"new thinking\" on how to tackle the problem was needed. This story has been corrected to show that of the two polio-endemic countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, only Pakistan has reported vaccine-derived polio cases.DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) — The California Horse Racing Board has chosen a longtime veterinarian as its new chairman. Gregory Ferraro was elected Thursday during the board\\'s meeting at Del Mar racetrack north of San Diego. He was appointed to the governing body five months ago by Gov. Ferraro noted the board has a mandate from Newsom\\'s office to focus on the health and safety of horses in the wake of 37 horse deaths at Santa Anita since last December. \"We have made several important new regulations and changes. There are many more to come,\" Ferraro said. \"We will gradually eliminate medication. We expect opposition to many of these, but we are determined to carry them out\". Ferraro served as director of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Center for Equine Health from 1997 to 2014. He owned his veterinary practice from 1972 to 1997. He earned a doctor of veterinary medicine degree from UC Davis and is a member of the American Association of Equine Practitioners and the American Veterinary Medical Association. Ferraro of San Francisco succeeds Chuck Winner, who ended his tenure as board chairman in October. Oscar Gonzales was elected as vice chairman, succeeding Madeline Auerbach, who retired earlier this month.DENVER (AP) — A Colorado county has approved spending $10 million on physical and technological upgrades at more than 100 schools and on mental health programming in response to a deadly school shooting in May. Douglas County commissioners on Thursday appropriated about $7.7 million for physical safety and set aside $1.3 million for technology for schools to deploy in the future, the Denver Post reported. About $990,000 will go toward mental health programs, including curriculum, training and surveys about school culture. That\\'s enough to cover schools\\' requests related to students\\' emotional needs, said Commissioner Abe Laydon. Ninety-one district schools applied for and received some funding, along with 15 charter schools and eight private schools. Laydon said the grants won\\'t be able to prevent all acts of violence, but they will make it more difficult to harm children in Douglas County. Commissioners also committed an additional $3 million to partially fund 26 police officers in county schools and $331,000 in ongoing funding for a mental health response team that launched Monday. The May 7 shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch south of Denver killed 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo and left eight other students injured. Two former students have been charged in the shooting and their cases are pending. At the meeting, Commissioner Roger Partridge asked for a moment of silence to honor Castillo — who died trying to disarm a gunman — and his parents. \"It was time for something to be done,\" Partridge said. Information from: The Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com.WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Authorities said Monday that a measles epidemic sweeping through Samoa continues to worsen with the death toll rising to 25, all but one of them young children. \"We still have a big problem at hand,\" Samoa\\'s Director General of Health Leausa Take Naseri said in a video statement. He said more than 140 new cases of people contracting the virus had been recorded within the past day, bringing the total to about 2,200 cases since the outbreak began last month. He said there are about 20 critically ill children who remain in hospital intensive care units. Samoa declared a state of emergency nine days ago, closing all its schools, banning children from public gatherings and mandating that everybody get vaccinated. Teams of people have been traveling the country administering thousands of vaccines. The government also shut down a private clinic and is investigating how hundreds of vaccines were taken without authorization and then sold for a fee. The median age of those who have died is 13 months, according to government figures. The deaths include 24 children under the age of 5, 11 of whom were infants under 12 months. The other person who died was in their 30s. In all, 679 people have been admitted to Samoan hospitals with the disease, accounting for two-thirds of all recent hospital admissions. A majority have been discharged, with about 183 remaining in hospitals. \"These hospitals are not designed to deal with this,\" Dr. Scott Wilson told Newshub in the capital, Apia. \"The minute you get hospitals running at 200 to 300 percent capacity — I think it speaks for itself. It\\'s incredibly serious\". Figures from the World Health Organization and UNICEF indicate that measles immunization rates among Samoan infants have fallen steeply from over 70% in 2013 to under 30% last year. Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at New Zealand\\'s University of Auckland, said the Samoan government halted its immunization program for several months last year after two infants died from a medical mishap involving a vaccine. Tonga, Fiji and New Zealand have also reported outbreaks of measles but on a smaller scale than in Samoa. American Samoa, which has declared a public health emergency, is requiring that travelers from Samoa and Tonga prove they have been vaccinated or are immune from measles before being allowed into the U.S. territory.RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — State officials are reminding Virginians it\\'s not too late to get their flu vaccine. The Virginia Department of Health encourages all Virginians older than 6 months to receive the vaccine. State health officials gathered last week for an event in Richmond to highlight the importance of the vaccine and get a flu shot themselves. Flu season normally begins in October. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination by the end of October is preferred, vaccination in November and beyond can be beneficial. Influenza activity usually peaks in January or later. The CDC warns the flu is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. The CDC also says vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce a child\\'s risk of dying from influenza.THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch government says that a doctor who contracted lassa fever while working in Sierra Leone has died. Health Minister Bruno Bruins said in a letter to Parliament Sunday that the doctor died Saturday. He was being treated for the hemorrhagic fever in an isolation ward at a university hospital in Leiden. Bruins said a second Dutch doctor who was working in Sierra Leone also has contracted lassa fever and been flown home and taken to a special hospital in the central city of Utrecht. The lassa cases are the first in the Netherlands since 2000. There is no vaccine for the disease, which is transmitted through the bodily fluids of sick people. Humans also can contract the disease by coming into contact with food contaminated by rat excrement.GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) — Thousands of students in Colorado were out of school Thursday because of a suspected outbreak of norovirus. All 46 schools in the district serving Grand Junction and the surrounding area were closed and won\\'t reopen until after the Thanksgiving break so custodians can disinfect surfaces. Norovirus is a highly contagious bug that causes diarrhea, vomiting and other symptoms, and can spread quickly in public places. It\\'s most common in winter but can be seen any time of year. The outbreak was first seen last week at a high school before spreading to other schools. Officials in the district, the largest in western Colorado with 22,000 students, believe there is now another related strain of the virus that has affected some students who were previously sick. \"We are taking this highly unusual action because this virus is extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools,\" district nursing coordinator Tanya Martin said. It\\'s not clear how many students have become sick. Some custodians also became ill, slowing down the cleaning process, but it\\'s unknown if the suspected viruses were to blame. Nicole Comstock, communicable disease deputy branch chief for the state Department of Public Health and Environment, told The Daily Sentinel that there are about 150 to 200 suspected norovirus outbreaks in the state each year. She said most occur at nursing homes but outbreaks at schools are not uncommon. The U.S. Air Force Academy outside Colorado Springs reported that 400 cadets have been sickened by norovirus since October, but the outbreak hasn\\'t disrupted classes. The Gazette reported that infected cadets are kept on bed rest for at least three days after their symptoms disappear before they can be cleared to return to class and training.MILAN (AP) — A Milan hospital is exhibiting X-rays of women attacked by men to highlight what one doctor calls the \"daily horror\" of violence against women. The San Carlo Hospital mounted the exhibit in its atrium to coincide with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which takes place on Monday. Patients\\' anonymity was respected in putting the five X-rays on display, including one showing the large blade of a knife lodged in a woman\\'s abdomen. Other X-rays show fractured limbs, including a shin bone broken in two. For the show\\'s inauguration on Thursday, Dr. Maria Grazia Vantadori, a hospital surgeon and liaison for women suffering violence from husbands, boyfriends, family members or acquaintances, noted that some patients don\\'t at first consider themselves domestic violence victims. \"Often the women who come to the emergency room, not knowing how to label what happened to them, don\\'t immediately say they have suffered violence,\\'\\' Vantadori said. But, Vantadori said, \"the bodies, the injuries speak for them and recount the spirals of daily horror\". Only in the last few years, have women in Italy started making significant inroads in an uphill cultural and legislative campaign to combat men\\'s violence against former and current wives and girlfriends, as well as against mothers, daughters and sisters. As recently as a generation ago, the Italian penal code still called for prison sentences as short as three years for men who killed women out of jealousy. Until 1981, the law sanctioned leniency for male defendants who slayed women to preserve the \"family honor\". But a cadre of courageous women, including some horribly disfigured after being doused with acid, are galvanizing other women — and men — to recognize the warning signs of domestic violence and to support those who want to get out of violent relationships. The Italian Parliament passed anti-stalking legislation in 2009. But there have been cases in which authorities underestimated the danger posed by jealous or vengeful men with whom the women have ended or tried to end relationships. On Friday, doctors and other hospital staff as well as those coming to the hospital for medical care stopped to view the X-rays, which reflected patient injuries from over the last 10 years, the hospital said. The exhibition runs through Dec. 9. D\\'Emilio reported from Rome.SEATTLE (AP) — Health officials say a resident of King County has been diagnosed with an E. coli infection connected to Salinas, California romaine lettuce. Public Health Seattle and King County officials said Friday the person became ill from eating leafy greens believed to have been purchased in King County. The person was hospitalized and is now recovering. Officials say the lettuce was genetically linked to a national outbreak involving romaine lettuce from Salinas. The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the outbreak Friday. The CDC recommends avoiding romaine lettuce from the Salinas, California area. Public Health is investigating additional E. coli cases among King County residents that may eventually be linked to the national outbreak, but officials say complete information on these cases is pending. Symptoms of an E. coli infection include diarrhea, severe stomach cramps, and vomiting.WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — A tiger that had been in declining health has died at a Wichita zoo. Jennica King, of the Sedgwick County Zoo, said the 14-year-old Amur tiger named Talali had not been on exhibit for several months. The Wichita Eagle reports that zookeepers had discovered a mass on her body and had been monitoring it, but her health quickly worsened. King said that on Sunday, Talali began having trouble moving around in her stall and seemed confused. They decided to euthanize her that morning. She had been part of the zoo\\'s Slawson Family Tiger Trek exhibit since it opened in 2009. Information from: The Wichita (Kan.)

(AP) — All University of Arkansas students are being required to have up-to-date vaccinations in order to attend classes following a mumps outbreak on campus. The state Department of Health on Friday issued a notice telling students they need to be immunized with at least two doses of the mumps vaccine or sit out of class for 26 days. The agency says nine cases of the viral disease have been diagnosed at the Fayetteville school this fall and other possible cases are being investigated. University spokesman Zac Brown says the school has vaccination records for its roughly 27,000 students and has already contacted the 407 who don\\'t have current vaccinations. Brown says the university anticipates many of those students will come to a health center to be inoculated Monday.The U.S. government is barring federal dollars meant for opioid addiction treatment to be used on medical marijuana. The move is aimed at states that allow marijuana for medical uses, particularly those letting patients with opioid addiction use pot as a treatment, said Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, whose federal agency doles out money to states for treatment programs. \"There\\'s zero evidence for that,\" McCance-Katz said. \"We felt that it was time to make it clear we did not want individuals receiving funds for treatment services to be exposed to marijuana and somehow given the impression that it\\'s a treatment\". It\\'s the latest example of the legal standoff between federal and state governments on marijuana. While cannabis is considered an illegal drug by federal officials, 33 states allow patients, with a doctor\\'s approval, to use it for medical purposes. About a dozen allow recreational use, too. The new restriction applies to the federal government\\'s two main grant programs for opioid treatment and an older grant program that supports state efforts to treat alcoholism and drug addiction. The rule affects billions of dollars from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Last week, federal officials held a phone call with state officials to spell out the restriction: Grant money can\\'t be used to directly or indirectly buy marijuana or permit treatment with pot. The rule also applies to using marijuana to treat mental health disorders. It does not apply to grants from other federal agencies for research on medical marijuana. Addiction treatment programs must document their efforts to urge patients to stop if they are currently using marijuana for mental health disorders or addiction, or the programs risk losing federal money, McCance-Katz said. Each state decides which ailments are on their medical marijuana lists. Many allow patients, with a doctor\\'s approval, to use it for chronic pain and symptoms of multiple sclerosis, where there is good scientific evidence. Other states have approved health conditions with less scientific backing, like post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety, swayed by firsthand experience from residents. The evidence that marijuana helps some patients use fewer opioids comes from anecdotal reports or surveys of drug users, which is not the type of research that can prove cause and effect. Earlier this year, a study shot down the notion that medical marijuana laws can prevent opioid overdose deaths, challenging a favorite talking point of legal pot advocates. Yet, the ongoing overdose crisis has caused New York, New Jersey and other states to turn to marijuana on the premise that pot \"is far less risky than injecting heroin or fentanyl, so why not try it?\" said Leo Beletsky, a public health policy expert at Northeastern University in Boston. In 2018, Pennsylvania became the first state to add opioid use disorder to its medical marijuana list. Tom Wolf, in an announcement of the decision, also designated eight universities to conduct research on marijuana\\'s use for that and other medical conditions. It is too early to tell if the new federal rule will affect care, said Rachel Kostelac, spokeswoman for Pennsylvania\\'s Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. \"But we will continue to monitor to ensure individuals are receiving appropriate treatment to combat the opioid epidemic\". New Mexico, which added opioid use disorder in June, determined that no federal money was going toward marijuana-related treatment, said David Morgan, spokesman for the state\\'s Department of Health.

But many of his inflammatory statements come from another place, an ethereal world where his sources are never identified:. \"They say. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". Over the past week of impeachment hearings, Trump blew past the consensus of national security and foreign policy professionals, dismissing them as Never Trumpers, and dug in with his theory of Ukrainian misdeeds that they said is false. In the course of that, he continued to describe an American company as a Ukrainian one and its American chief as a Ukrainian rich man. Here\\'s a look at some of the rhetoric from and about the House Intelligence Committee hearings as well as some remarks by Democratic presidential contenders who tried in their latest debate to be heard above the impeachment din:. TRUMP, referring to Democrats: \"The FBI went in and they told them, get out of here, you\\'re not getting — we\\'re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it\\'s called, which is a country — which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That\\'s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company? Why?\" — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s statement is false in multiple ways. CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company — it is based in Sunnyvale, California. It is not owned by a Ukrainian, but rather an American who emigrated to the U.S. as a child — from Russia, not Ukraine. The cybersecurity firm made the original determination that Russia was responsible for the 2016 hack of Democratic emails that were subsequently disclosed by WikiLeaks. The company counts among its clients the National Republican Congressional Committee, for which it investigated email thefts by unidentified hackers during the 2018 campaign. When Trump says the \"FBI has never gotten that server,\" he is referring to the fact that the FBI did not receive physical servers from the Democratic National Committee after its emails were hacked in the 2016 campaign. Instead, the FBI relied on detailed forensics provided by CrowdStrike. The FBI confirmed those findings. Using that evidence, special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s team charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with the hack. Still, Trump persists not only in misidentifying the nationality of the owner and what country the firm is from, but in advancing the notion that Ukrainians hacked the DNC and made it look as if Russians did it. TRUMP: \"A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right, from the DNC, Democratic National Committee, you know. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump is shrugging off not only the week\\'s testimony of current and former aides at the hearing, but advice going back months from officials who told him such assertions are invalid. None of the witnesses who testified at the hearings — including those the Republicans wanted to hear from — gave credence to Trump\\'s theory that Ukraine attacked the U.S. election and tried to make Russia look like the villain. Several testified to the contrary, that there is no evidence of Ukraine interference. Even before his July phone call pressing Ukraine\\'s president to investigate the theory, his own staff repeatedly told him it was \"completely debunked,\" Trump\\'s first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said in September. \"Fictions,\" a former senior director on the National Security Council for Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, testified Thursday. She told committee members: \"I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests\". TRUMP: \"I don\\'t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy, though. But I don\\'t know him well\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: That\\'s not credible. Testimony by several officials revealed that Sondland, Trump\\'s EU ambassador, was in frequent contact with Trump around the time Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about doing a politically beneficial \"favor\". Tim Morrison, the former NSC Russia and Europe senior director, who took over from Hill in July, told House investigators that Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released as Trump pressed for the favor. Morrison said the ambassador \"related to me he was acting — he was discussing these matters with the president\". Sondland himself changed his testimony Wednesday to acknowledge more contacts with Trump than previously revealed. As recently as Oct. 8, Trump had tweeted that Sondland was a \"really good man and great American\". Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\\'s inaugural committee before being named the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. But Trump quickly became less familiar with his ambassador when Sondland testified that the president wanted a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats as a condition for his releasing U.S. military aid to that country. PAM BONDI, White House adviser: \"We\\'re going to hear what Gordon Sondland has to say today. He was the ambassador to the Ukraine\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: Sondland is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, not Ukraine. TRUMP: \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn\\'t care about American Workers!\" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Neither happened. Trump visited a factory in Austin, Texas, that has made the Mac Pro for Apple since 2013. Apple announced in September that it would continue having the Mac Pro line made in Austin, after the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on certain computer parts from China. It also plans to expand its already deeply rooted business in Austin and said Wednesday it has started construction of its new campus in the city. None of that equates to Trump\\'s false claim to have opened an Apple plant Wednesday. Meantime, the House worked into Wednesday evening, after Trump\\'s false tweet that Pelosi had shut Congress, and again Thursday before breaking for Thanksgiving week. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, Democratic committee chairman: \"I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression, listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing, that Russia didn\\'t intervene in our election. It was all the Ukrainians\". — hearing Thursday. HILL: \"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves\". — hearing Thursday. REP. ELISE STEFANIK, Republican of New York: \"Not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections. To have our Democratic colleagues say these untruthful statements just reeks of political desperation\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Stefanik may be right that Republicans on the committee did not explicitly deny that Russia attacked the U.S. election. Yet Schiff and Hill may also be right in saying that Republicans left that impression at the hearings. Some Republicans on the committee repeatedly gave credence to the conspiracy theory that holds that Ukrainians actually hacked the Democratic National Committee emails, perhaps with a server that was in their country, and made it look as if Russia did it. To buy into this theory is to discount Russian culpability. A 2018 report by the then-Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election, but disagreed with parts of the agencies\\' assessment that said Russia did so to help Trump. REP. DEVIN NUNES of California: Trump has good reason to be wary \"of widespread corruption in that country\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: The committee\\'s top Republican is pointing to an oft-made defense by Trump and GOP allies that he withheld military aid to Ukraine because of concerns about corruption. But the hearings produced bountiful testimony that Trump was singularly focused on making Democrats the target of Ukrainian investigations. In his first phone call with Ukraine\\'s new leader, in April, the White House said at the time that Trump discussed his interest in having Ukraine rein in widespread corruption. But in the recently released rough transcript of the call, he did not mention corruption at all. Trump had $391 million in congressionally approved U.S. assistance withheld from Ukraine from July to September. The Defense Department had already certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the military assistance. Before the July hold on the aid, the Trump administration had approved sending aid to Ukraine nearly 50 times without holding it because of corruption concerns. Witnesses testified that Trump did not articulate concerns about Ukraine corruption other than expressing interest into investigations that would benefit him politically. In his July 25 call, Trump told Zelenskiy as they discussed military aid, \"I would like for you to do us a favor, though\" and investigate Joe Biden, his son and Democrats going back to the 2016 U.S. election, citing in part the discredited conspiracy theory involving Ukraine in that election. Trump ultimately released the aid, on Sept. 11, after Congress became aware of what he had done. A few days earlier, congressional committees had begun looking into the matter, aware that a whistleblower had a complaint in motion. NUNES: \"Now that the whistleblower has successfully kickstarted impeachment, he has disappeared from the story, as if the Democrats put the whistleblower in their own witness protection program\". — hearing Tuesday. THE FACTS: The whistleblower hasn\\'t \"disappeared\". That person has offered to submit written testimony; Republicans have rejected that. Trump and his GOP allies are suggesting that the whistleblower\\'s complaint is false, and so the person has vanished. But key details were corroborated by people with firsthand knowledge of the events who appeared on Capitol Hill. TRUMP: \"Right now you have a kangaroo court headed by little shifty Schiff, where we don\\'t have lawyers, we don\\'t have witnesses, we don\\'t have anything\". — Cabinet meeting. THE FACTS: Depends on the meaning of \"we\". Republicans on the committee had a lawyer asking questions of the witnesses, so it\\'s not true that they had no legal representation. And several witnesses were invited at the request of Republicans on the committee. It\\'s also true, though, that Trump himself did not have a lawyer speaking for him at the hearings. That\\'s not unusual. The inquiry is meant to be a fact-finding process and the president is not charged with anything. He will have legal representation if the House Judiciary Committee moves ahead to draft articles of impeachment against him. BERNIE SANDERS: \"What the scientists are telling us is if we don\\'t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we\\'re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we\\'re talking about increased drought, we\\'re talking about increased extreme weather disturbances\". — Democratic debate Wednesday. THE FACTS: To be clear, the world\\'s big cities aren\\'t going to go underwater for good in as soon as eight to nine years. The Vermont senator\\'s reference to eight to nine years seems to refer to standard warnings of the expected temperature increases kicking in by roughly 2030, and the progressively worse weather extremes that will keep following. JOE BIDEN: \"The fact is the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That statement is at odds with a Kaiser Family Foundation poll out this week. It found that 77% of Democrats support Medicare for All. Even more — 88% — support a \"public option\" proposal such as the one Biden advocates. It would allow people to buy into a new government insurance plan modeled on Medicare, but it would not completely replace private insurance. Overall, 53% of Americans support Medicare for All, while 43% oppose it, according to the Kaiser poll. It\\'s also true, though, that public support for Medicare for All declines when costs and other, similar details are introduced in the polling. ELIZABETH WARREN: \"Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, (of) whites who borrowed money, 94% have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African Americans have paid it off\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That\\'s not right. Warren appears to be citing a September report from Brandeis University\\'s Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The study found that, 20 years after starting college, 49% of white borrowers had paid off their loans entirely (not 94% of them) compared with 26% of black borrowers (not 5%). The study also found that the typical white student had paid off 94% of his or her debt, while the typical black borrower had only paid off 5%. Warren cited those statistics, but in the wrong way. She\\'s correct that there are disparities by race when it comes to paying back student loans. Other studies have similarly found that black borrowers are at greater risk of default than their white counterparts. TULSI GABBARD: \"The most recent example of inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels\". — Democratic debate. PETE BUTTIGIEG: \"That is outlandish, even by the standards of today\\'s politics. I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We\\'ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\" — Democratic debate. GABBARD: \"You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes. The fact checkers can check this out\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: Neither offered a fully accurate account in their exchange. Gabbard did not accuse Buttigieg of being open to \"invading\" Mexico, as he suggested she did. But she did not explain the context of his remarks at a Latino-issues forum in Los Angeles last Sunday. At the forum, he heavily conditioned the idea of sending troops to help Mexico fight the drug and gang war, saying he would only do so if Mexico wanted the assistance as part of a security partnership. \"There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,\" he said in Los Angeles. \"I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this were necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations. \"But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role if and only if it is welcome by our partner south of the border\". Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Mary Clare Jalonick, Lisa Mascaro, Lynn Berry, Mark Sherman, Kevin Freking, Ellen Knickmeyer and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington, Collin Binkley in Boston, Kathleen Ronayne in Los Angeles and Amanda Seitz in Chicago contributed to this report. Find AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd. Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck.WASHINGTON (AP) — Medicare\\'s revamped prescription plan finder can steer unwitting seniors to coverage that costs much more than they need to pay, according to people who help with sign-ups as well as program experts. Serving some 60 million Medicare recipients, the plan finder is the most commonly used tool on Medicare.gov and just got its first major update in a decade. The Trump administration has hailed the new version and Medicare Administrator Seema Verma says it will empower beneficiaries to take advantage of their coverage options. But as open enrollment goes into the home stretch Thanksgiving week, critics say the new tool can create confusion by obscuring out-of-pocket costs that seniors should factor into their decisions. \"I want to make sure people are given the most accurate information and they\\'re making the best decision — because they are the ones stuck with it,\" said Ann Kayrish, senior program manager for Medicare at the National Council on Aging, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for seniors and provides community services. Government programs mixing health care and technology have faced struggles. Despite billions spent to subsidize electronic medical records, getting different systems to communicate remains a challenge. The Obama administration\\'s launch of HealthCare.gov resulted in an embarrassing debacle when the website froze up the first day. The leading Democrat on the Senate Aging Committee said he\\'s hearing concerns from constituents and organizations that assist Medicare beneficiaries. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey said he will ask Medicare to grant seniors who\\'ve had problems a second chance to sign up, called a \"special enrollment period\". \"It\\'s obviously an effort that needs a lot more work to meet the legitimate expectations of seniors,\" said Casey. \"Especially when you launch something new, (it) can go awry. People steered in the wrong direction should get a measure of fairness\". The Medicare plan finder\\'s issue stems from a significant change the agency made for 2020. The plan with the lowest premium now gets automatically placed on top, with the monthly premium displayed in large font. Medicare\\'s previous plan finder automatically sorted plans by total cost, not just premiums. But premiums are only one piece of information. When out-of-pocket expenses such as copays are factored in, the plan with the lowest total annual cost is often not the first one shown by the plan finder. It takes extra work for a Medicare enrollee to discover that. \"If they pick the plan based solely on the premium they are likely getting a plan that could cost them thousands more in a calendar year,\" said Christina Reeg of the Ohio Department of Insurance. She heads a program that helps Medicare enrollees try to find the right plan. In a statement, Medicare said the monthly premium is a cost that consumers understand and will always be an important decision factor. But the agency also said total cost paid out-of-pocket is at least equally, if not more important, particularly for people who take prescription drugs — as do most seniors. Medicare said it\\'s testing ways to encourage consumers to look at total costs, such as a pop-up. The agency said it chose to prominently display premiums because user testing showed that\\'s what consumers are familiar with. The total annual cost is included, but in smaller font. That\\'s puzzling to Kayrish. The lowest premium \"doesn\\'t necessarily translate to lowest cost over the year,\" she explained. Consumers using the plan finder first enter their medications and dosages. To get it to find plans by lowest total annual cost, they must take a few more steps, said Kayrish. After the screen displays initial search results, consumers should look for the drop-down menu on the right of the screen. Next, she said, select the feature that lets you re-sort plans by \"lowest drug + premium cost\". A reporter\\'s sample search on a list of six medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes returned 29 plans in the Washington, D.C., area, topped by a lowest-premium option for $13.20 a month. But after re-sorting for the lowest total cost, the best deal was a plan with a monthly premium of $25.80. When out-of-pocket expenses were factored in, the second plan cost about $5,800 less a year than the initial lowest-premium option the plan finder displayed. Costs can vary so much because plans have different coverage designs and they don\\'t pay the same prices to drugmakers. And Kayrish said there\\'s another issue: The new plan finder can return options that don\\'t cover all of a patient\\'s medications. If a low-premium plan has very high out-of-pocket costs, it\\'s a clue that some of your drugs may not be covered. Check plan details. Some academic experts compared the old and new versions of the Medicare plan finder and confirmed the problems flagged by hands-on users. Their review also found improvements. Among them:. — Consumers can enter their Medicare number and the new plan finder automatically fills in all the medications the program paid for. (Consumer advocates recommend double-checking this list.) — The new tool can be used more easily on mobile devices and tablets. — The revamped plan finder allows consumers to compare across Part D drug plans and Medicare Advantage medical plans. \"The new plan finder is in many ways improved, but it did take a meaningful step backward by not doing more to highlight its most useful output— the total cost estimate,\" said Brian McGarry, an assistant professor at the University of Rochester in New York. He\\'s the lead author of a recent online article about the plan finder for Health Affairs. Seniors have until Dec. 7 to pick or switch \"Part D\" prescription drug plans or, if they\\'re seeking comprehensive medical care through a private insurer, a Medicare Advantage plan.

(AP) — Rhode Island House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello says he\\'ll consider whether to ban the sale of flavored vaping products in the next legislative session. Massachusetts lawmakers passed a groundbreaking ban Thursday on the sale of flavored tobacco and vaping products, sending it to the governor. Mattiello, a Democrat, said Thursday the House will address vaping, a \"very serious health concern\". He says he anticipates robust committee hearings and looks forward to testimony from medical experts. A Senate spokesman says the Senate president also expects legislation to be submitted and reviewed after they convene in January. Gina Raimondo signed an executive order in September, banning the sale of flavored vaping products. In response, the health department issued emergency regulations Oct. 4 to implement a four-month ban, with an optional two-month extension.PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine plans to launch a $1.5 expansion of syringe exchanges to combat the surge in hepatitis C cases in the state. The Maine Center for Disease Control says the state has had 51 acute cases in 2019 and is running a rate nearly three times the national average. Director of the Maine CDC, Dr. Nirav Shah, says the cases of hepatitis C in Maine is \"an unfortunate outcropping of the substance use crisis\". Executive director of the Health Equity Alliance, Kenney Miller, says the long-term goal\\'s to have at least one syringe exchange in all 16 counties. The Portland Press Herald reports there are currently exchange programs in Bangor, Ellsworth, Belfast, Machias, Portland, Augusta and Waterville. Shah says increasing the number of exchanges is one of the top priorities of the Mills administration. This story has been corrected to show there are 51 cases of acute hepatitis C diagnosed in Maine this year, not 59.SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — A fifth Illinois resident has died after being hospitalized with a vaping-related lung injury. The Illinois Department of Public Health on Thursday did not release any information about the victim, nor when or where the death occurred. According to the department, 187 people in Illinois, ranging from 13 years to 75 years old have experienced lung injuries after e-cigarette use. Public Health director Dr. Ngozi Ezike says it is important that people not use e-cigarettes or vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The highest risk for lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes appears to be among those who use THC containing products. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says as of Nov. 20, there have been 2,290 reported cases of lung injuries resulting from e-cigarette use nationwide, with 47 deaths.TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — University of Arizona\\'s medical school announced Friday that it will give free tuition to some students who commit to working as primary care doctors in underserved areas, an effort to improve access to health care in areas where it\\'s most lacking. Up to 94 students will get scholarships on campuses in Phoenix and Tucson, the UA Colleges of Medicine said. For each year of tuition waived, they\\'ll have to commit to working in an underserved area after their residency for one year. The scholarships are funded with $3 million from an $8 million state funding plan approved earlier this year. The rest of that money will allow growth from 80 to 100 medical students at UA\\'s Phoenix campus. State and federal governments have looked to a wide variety of grants, scholarships, loan forgiveness and other initiatives to seek out doctors willing to work in underserved areas and support them financially. An aging population and projected physician retirements have fueled concerns that the U.S. will face a growing shortage of providers — a problem felt hardest in lower-income areas. Physician groups say high debt burdens discourage new doctors from working in primary care in rural or urban underserved areas, which tend to come with lower salaries than jobs in specialties or wealthy areas. Debt concerns discourage some would-be doctors from even applying to medical school, Dr. Michael Dake, senior vice president of UA Health Sciences, said in a news release. The scholarships will be available only to UA students who qualify as Arizona residents. Eligible post-residency specializations include family medicine, general internal medicine, geriatrics, pediatrics, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology. Eligible underserved areas are designated by the federal government based on having too few doctors, high infant mortality rates, high poverty or a large elderly population. UA medical school tuition for Arizona residents is about $33,000 per year. Medical school is four years. Arizona\\'s physician training capacity has grown in recent years with the opening of the UA\\'s Phoenix campus and schools run by the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, A.T. Still University in Mesa and Midwestern University in Glendale. Nebraska-based Creighton University is building a health sciences campus that will include a medical school in midtown Phoenix.FAIRFAX COUNTY, Va. (AP) — Firefighters in Virginia are taking part in a study aimed at finding ways to reduce their exposure to carcinogens. WTOP-FM reports that the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department is partnering with the National Fire Protection Association Research Foundation on a four-phase study. Part of the focus of the study will be on how chemicals can cling to breathing equipment used by firefighters. Firefighters are exposed to toxic chemicals released into the air by burning buildings and vehicles. According to a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study, firefighters are twice as likely to get skin and testicular cancer and mesothelioma. Information from: WTOP-FM, http://www.wtop.com.WASHINGTON (AP) — In almost any other year it would be hailed as a public health victory: The smoking rate among U.S. high schoolers took its biggest hit ever this year, federal figures show, falling to a new low. Instead the milestone was relegated to a lone figure at the bottom of a government press release and went unremarked by anti-tobacco groups that have spent decades working to stamp out youth smoking. It\\'s a new era in the tobacco wars — one in which the alarming rise of underage vaping has almost completely overshadowed a parallel drop in traditional smoking. And the pivotal question of whether electronic cigarettes are inadvertently helping to wipe out smoking among young people has become a polarizing topic: embraced by some experts, dismissed by others. \"Smoking is disappearing among young people and it\\'s a great public health triumph that we are failing to celebrate, much less even note,\" says Kenneth Warner, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan\\'s school of public health. E-cigarettes typically heat a solution that contains nicotine, the drug that makes tobacco addictive. They are generally considered less harmful than cancer-causing traditional cigarettes. But there is little long-term research on the health effects of vaping. With one in four teenagers now using e-cigarettes, underage vaping is universally condemned, and the federal government considers it an epidemic. But Warner and some other researchers believe recent trends continue to show vaping\\'s promise as a tool to steer millions of adults away from cigarette smoking, the nation\\'s leading cause of death. That potential makes the case for keeping e-cigarettes readily accessible for adults — even if a certain level of teen use persists. But that approach is a non-starter for many tobacco opponents. \"When adults make policy gains on the backs of children, that\\'s bad, and that\\'s what the argument boils down to here,\" says Dave Dobbins, an attorney with the anti-tobacco nonprofit, Truth Initiative. Even if e-cigarettes were responsible for the smoking decline among teenagers — which Dobbins says is unlikely — allowing young people to get hooked on vaping nicotine is not a solution. \"I don\\'t buy the argument that these things showed up and magically changed the world,\" says Dobbins. Instead, he thinks the vaping industry has increasingly pursued young people as smoking has fallen out of fashion. But no one disputes the decline. The percentage of high schoolers who reported smoking fell to 5.8% in 2019 from the prior year, a 28% drop and the largest since the U.S. government began surveying teens, according to preliminary numbers released in September. The trend isn\\'t limited to one year or one survey. A similar study conducted by the University of Michigan shows smoking among 12th graders has plummeted 50% since 2015, the largest drop of its kind in the survey\\'s 40-year history. The smoking rate for adults is roughly 14% and has been falling slowly for decades. The decline among teens has been seized upon by vaping proponents, who argue it undercuts the gravest argument against the nicotine-emitting devices: that they act as a \"gateway\" to traditional smoking. That\\'s the conclusion of a number of short-term studies that followed young people and surveyed their use of tobacco and nicotine. The prestigious National Academies found \"substantial evidence\" for the gateway effect in a 2018 consensus paper. And the Food and Drug Administration even uses the concept as the tagline in its anti-vaping video ads: \"Teens who vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes\". For now, experts on both sides acknowledge there is no definitive evidence linking e-cigarettes to the decline in youth smoking. The question is clouded by too many long-term trends and complicating variables. Teen smoking has been decreasing since the late 1990s and is influenced by government policies, public opinion, changing products and tobacco industry marketing. But for researchers who believe vaping is benefiting public health, the falling numbers make one thing clear: E-cigarettes are not driving large numbers of young people to smoke. The numbers suggest the exact opposite. \"The key point here is that it seems we have seen a drastic reduction in smoking,\" says Dr. David Levy, a tobacco researcher at Georgetown University. \"That\\'s clearly a good thing and it\\'s not something that we want to mess with\". The question of how to best regulate e-cigarettes remains unresolved in Washington. The Trump administration has recently backed away from an earlier plan to ban virtually all vaping flavors due to their appeal to teens. No deadline has been set for a new proposal or announcement. Levy and others favor targeted approaches to curb youth use, such as raising the minimum purchase age to 21 nationwide. They oppose sweeping bans and restrictions, which could impact use by adult smokers. In a paper last year, Levy, Warner and several colleagues estimated that smoking among 12th graders has fallen three times faster since an uptick of e-cigarette use around 2014, compared with the earlier long-term trend. However, the authors did not conclude that e-cigarettes caused the decline and noted that it could have been influenced by other factors, such as anti-tobacco campaigns. Brian King of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also emphasized that survey data cannot prove a cause and effect between vaping and smoking rates. Therefore, it\\'s impossible to know which teens avoided or quit smoking due to vaping, versus those who would never have picked up cigarettes anyway. Additionally, the data suggest many of the estimated 5.3 million underage students who vape were never at risk to become smokers. \"So that reflects an on-ramp to nicotine use that we otherwise would not have had without e-cigarettes,\" says King, a deputy director in CDC\\'s Office of Smoking and Health. The CDC and other health experts warn that nicotine can harm parts of the developing brain that control learning, memory and mood in young people. The vaping debate underscores a growing rift in the tobacco control field. For decades, advocates, regulators and researchers were united in a common fight against cigarettes, which cause cancer, heart disease, stroke and many other deadly diseases. But views have diverged since the introduction of e-cigarettes and other alternative products. Some experts believe the most realistic approach is to shift smokers away from burning tobacco toward less-risky products. On the other side are those who say there is no safe way to use tobacco or nicotine and quitting should be the goal. With local, state and other authorities cracking down on e-cigarettes — particularly kid-friendly flavors — public sentiment has increasingly been turning against vaping. On Tuesday the influential American Medical Association called for a \"total ban\" on all e-cigarettes and vaping products. Some longtime industry observers warn that vaping proponents may have missed their opportunity to benefit public health. \"The industry blew it,\" said Dr. David Kessler, speaking at a recent conference for vaping and tobacco executives. Kessler served as FDA commissioner during the 1990s, when he tried unsuccessfully to assert authority over tobacco products. Congress did not grant the FDA that power until 2009. Starting in May, all e-cigarettes will need to undergo FDA review. Only those that can demonstrate a benefit for U.S. public health will be permitted to stay on the market. Some vaping companies expect to win the FDA\\'s endorsement, but Kessler noted: \"I don\\'t see it\". \"You lost the trust of the American public when it comes to vaping and you\\'ve set back the issue decades,\" he said.

The \"No Safe Vape\" effort includes a website that presents facts about vaping and a list of local, regional and national resources for those seeking further information or help quitting. An advertising campaign is planned, and the health system also hosted a Facebook Live event with experts and teens. Dr. Susanne Tanski, a Dartmouth-Hitchcock pediatrician, also briefed members of the U.S. Senate last week about the hazards of vaping. As electronic cigarette use by teenagers has surged, health advocates are encouraging President Donald Trump to move forward with a federal ban on thousands of flavors used in vaping products.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump\\'s latest reasons for firing Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine: She was an \"Obama person\" who refused to hang Trump\\'s portrait in the U.S. Embassy. That\\'s false on both counts. Trump\\'s pique about not having his picture displayed in a timely way — actually the fault of his administration, not the ambassador — came during a week of unfounded or distorted statements by the president about the impeachment inquiry and the political favor he sought from Ukraine. A look at recent claims, as well as from Democratic presidential contenders in their latest debate:. TRUMP: \"This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful, she wouldn\\'t hang my picture in the embassy. She\\'s in charge of the embassy. She wouldn\\'t hang it. It took like a year and a half or two years for her to get the picture up\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: She\\'s not the reason why Trump\\'s photo wasn\\'t displayed in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine after his inauguration. Trump\\'s official portrait for display in federal facilities was not released by the White House until October 2017. Portraits for U.S. embassies came months after that. Lewis Lukens, former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in London, tweeted Friday: \"I was in charge of the US embassy in London for much of Trump\\'s first year. We didn\\'t hang his picture either. It took the WH almost 15 months to get official photos sent to embassies to hang. And we were instructed not to print other photos\". The former ambassador to Georgia, Ian Kelly, tweeted: \"Our official White House portraits did not arrive at Embassy Tbilisi until March 2018. This was because the WH was late getting them to all embassies\". Yovanovitch\\'s attorney, Larry Robbins, told The Associated Press that the embassy in Kyiv hung Trump\\'s official portrait, along with Vice President Mike Pence\\'s and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\'s, \"as soon as they arrived from Washington, DC\". Trump previously accused Yovanovitch of leaving countries in disarray \"everywhere\" she went as a diplomat, wholly misrepresenting her record. In any event, a president doesn\\'t need to give a reason for firing an ambassador. TRUMP: \"This was an Obama person\". — Fox interview. THE FACTS: No, she is a nonpartisan civil servant who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations as a 33-year State Department employee. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and then Armenia by Republican President George W. Bush. Then she was named to the Ukraine ambassadorship by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2016. Trump dismissed her from that post in May. TRUMP: \"Why isn\\'t Germany, France, the European Union, why aren\\'t all those countries in Europe, why aren\\'t they paying? Why is it always the United States the sucker? I got elected on that\". — Fox interview Friday. THE FACTS: He\\'s incorrect that the U.S. is \"always\" the one putting up Ukraine aid. European Union institutions have provided far more development assistance than the $204 million from Washington. Specific EU members, Japan and Canada also contribute significantly. Since 2014, the EU and European financial institutions have mobilized more than $16 billion to help Ukraine\\'s economy, counter corruption, build institutions and strengthen its sovereignty against further incursions by Russia after its annexation of Crimea. The U.S. is a heavy source of military assistance. The aid package held back by Trump as he pressed Ukraine to investigate Democrats was worth nearly $400 million. But NATO also contributes a variety of military-assistance programs and trust funds for Ukraine. In most such cases, the programs are modest and NATO countries other than the U.S. take the lead. TRUMP: \"Why should we give money to a country that\\'s known corrupt?\" — Fox News interview Friday. REP. DEVIN NUNES of California, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee: Trump has good reason to be wary \"of widespread corruption in that country\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s defense that he withheld aid to Ukraine due to corruption concerns is shaky. Two weeks of hearings produced bountiful testimony that Trump was singularly focused on getting Ukraine to open investigations into Democrats. In his first phone call with Ukraine\\'s new leader, in April, the White House said at the time that Trump discussed his interest in having Ukraine rein in widespread corruption. But in the recently released rough transcript of the call, he actually did not mention corruption at all. Trump had $391 million in congressionally approved U.S. assistance withheld from Ukraine from July to September. The Defense Department had already certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the military assistance. Before the July hold on the aid, the Trump administration had approved sending aid to Ukraine nearly 50 times without holding it because of corruption concerns. Witnesses testified that Trump did not articulate concerns about Ukraine corruption other than expressing interest into investigations that would benefit him politically. In his July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as they discussed military aid, \"I would like for you to do us a favor, though\" and investigate Joe Biden, his son and Democrats going back to the 2016 U.S. election, based on a discredited theory involving purported Ukrainian interference in the election. Trump ultimately released the aid, on Sept. 11, after Congress became aware of what he had done. A few days earlier, congressional committees had begun looking into the matter, aware that a whistleblower had a complaint in motion. TRUMP, referring to Democrats: \"The FBI went in and they told them, get out of here, you\\'re not getting — we\\'re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it\\'s called, which is a country — which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That\\'s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company? Why?\" — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s statement is false in multiple ways. CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company — it is based in Sunnyvale, California. It is not owned by a Ukrainian, but rather an American who emigrated to the U.S. as a child — from Russia, not Ukraine. The cybersecurity firm made the original determination that Russia was responsible for the 2016 hack of Democratic emails that were subsequently disclosed by WikiLeaks. The company counts among its clients the National Republican Congressional Committee, for which it investigated email thefts by unidentified hackers during the 2018 campaign. When Trump says the \"FBI has never gotten that server,\" he is referring to the fact that the FBI did not receive physical servers from the Democratic National Committee after its emails were hacked in the 2016 campaign. Instead, the FBI relied on detailed forensics provided by CrowdStrike. The FBI confirmed those findings. Using that evidence, special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s team charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with the hack. Still, Trump persists not only in misidentifying the nationality of the owner and what country the firm is from, but in advancing the notion that Ukrainians hacked the DNC and made it look as if Russians did it. TRUMP: \"A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right, from the DNC, Democratic National Committee, you know. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump is shrugging off not only the week\\'s testimony of current and former aides at the hearing, but advice going back months from officials who told him such assertions are invalid. None of the witnesses who testified at the hearings — including those the Republicans wanted to hear from — gave credence to Trump\\'s theory that Ukraine attacked the U.S. election and tried to make Russia look like the villain. Several testified to the contrary, that there is no evidence of Ukraine interference. Even before his July phone call pressing Ukraine\\'s president to investigate the theory, his own staff repeatedly told him it was \"completely debunked,\" Trump\\'s first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said in September. \"Fictions,\" a former senior director on the National Security Council for Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, testified Thursday. She told committee members: \"I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests\". TRUMP: \"I hardly know him, OK?\" — Fox interview Friday. TRUMP: \"I don\\'t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy, though. But I don\\'t know him well\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: That\\'s not credible. Testimony by several officials revealed that Sondland, Trump\\'s EU ambassador, was in frequent contact with Trump around the time Trump spoke with Zelenskiy about doing a politically beneficial \"favor\". Tim Morrison, the former NSC Russia and Europe senior director, who took over from Hill in July, told House investigators that Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released as Trump pressed for the favor. Morrison said the ambassador \"related to me he was acting — he was discussing these matters with the president\". Sondland himself changed his testimony Wednesday to acknowledge more contacts with Trump than previously revealed. As recently as Oct. 8, Trump had tweeted that Sondland was a \"really good man and great American\". Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\\'s inaugural committee before being named the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. But Trump quickly became less familiar with his ambassador when Sondland testified that the president wanted a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats as a condition for his releasing U.S. military aid to that country. TRUMP: \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn\\'t care about American Workers!\" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Neither happened. Trump visited a factory in Austin, Texas, that has made the Mac Pro for Apple since 2013. Apple announced in September that it would continue having the Mac Pro line made in Austin, after the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on certain computer parts from China. It also plans to expand its already deeply rooted business in Austin and said Wednesday it has started construction of its new campus in the city. None of that equates to Trump\\'s false claim to have opened an Apple plant Wednesday. Meantime, the House worked into Wednesday evening, after Trump\\'s false tweet that Pelosi had shut Congress, and again Thursday before breaking for Thanksgiving week. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, Democratic chairman of the intelligence committee: \"I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression, listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing, that Russia didn\\'t intervene in our election. It was all the Ukrainians\". — hearing Thursday. HILL: \"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves\". — hearing Thursday. REP. ELISE STEFANIK, Republican of New York: \"Not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections. To have our Democratic colleagues say these untruthful statements just reeks of political desperation\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Stefanik may be right that Republicans on the committee did not explicitly deny that Russia attacked the U.S. election. Yet Schiff and Hill may also be right in saying that Republicans left that impression at the hearings. Some Republicans on the committee repeatedly gave credence to the conspiracy theory that holds that Ukrainians actually hacked the Democratic National Committee emails, perhaps with a server that was in their country, and made it look as if Russia did it. To buy into this theory is to discount Russian culpability. A 2018 report by the then-Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election, but disagreed with parts of the agencies\\' assessment that said Russia did so to help Trump. TRUMP: \"Right now you have a kangaroo court headed by little shifty Schiff, where we don\\'t have lawyers, we don\\'t have witnesses, we don\\'t have anything\". — Cabinet meeting Tuesday. THE FACTS: Depends on the meaning of \"we\". Republicans on the committee had a lawyer asking questions of the witnesses, so it\\'s not true that they had no legal representation. And several witnesses were invited at the request of Republicans on the committee. It\\'s also true, though, that Trump himself did not have a lawyer speaking for him at the hearings. That\\'s not unusual. The inquiry is meant to be a fact-finding process and the president is not charged with anything. He will have legal representation if the House Judiciary Committee moves ahead to draft articles of impeachment against him. BERNIE SANDERS: \"What the scientists are telling us is if we don\\'t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we\\'re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we\\'re talking about increased drought, we\\'re talking about increased extreme weather disturbances\". — Democratic debate Wednesday. THE FACTS: To be clear, the world\\'s big cities aren\\'t going to go underwater for good in as soon as eight to nine years. The Vermont senator\\'s reference to eight to nine years seems to refer to standard warnings of the expected temperature increases kicking in by roughly 2030, and the progressively worse weather extremes that will keep following. JOE BIDEN: \"The fact is the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: The former vice president\\'s statement is at odds with a Kaiser Family Foundation poll out this week. It found that 77% of Democrats support Medicare for All. Even more — 88% — support a \"public option\" proposal such as the one Biden advocates. It would allow people to buy into a new government insurance plan modeled on Medicare, but it would not completely replace private insurance. Overall, 53% of Americans support Medicare for All, while 43% oppose it, according to the Kaiser poll. It\\'s also true, though, that public support for Medicare for All declines when costs and other, similar details are introduced in the polling. ELIZABETH WARREN: \"Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, (of) whites who borrowed money, 94% have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African Americans have paid it off\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That\\'s not right. The Massachusetts senator appears to be citing a September report from Brandeis University\\'s Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The study found that, 20 years after starting college, 49% of white borrowers had paid off their loans entirely (not 94% of them) compared with 26% of black borrowers (not 5%). The study also found that the typical white student had paid off 94% of his or her debt, while the typical black borrower had only paid off 5%. Warren cited those statistics, but in the wrong way. She\\'s correct that there are disparities by race when it comes to paying back student loans. Other studies have similarly found that black borrowers are at greater risk of default than their white counterparts. TULSI GABBARD: \"The most recent example of inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels\". — Democratic debate. PETE BUTTIGIEG: \"That is outlandish, even by the standards of today\\'s politics. I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We\\'ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\" — Democratic debate. GABBARD: \"You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: Neither offered a fully accurate account in their exchange. Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman, did not accuse Buttigieg of being open to \"invading\" Mexico, as he suggested she did. But she did not explain the context of Buttigieg\\'s remarks at a Latino-issues forum in Los Angeles last Sunday. At the forum, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, heavily conditioned the idea of sending troops to help Mexico fight the drug and gang war, saying he would only do so if Mexico wanted the assistance as part of a security partnership. \"There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,\" Buttigieg said in Los Angeles. \"I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this were necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations. \"But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role if and only if it is welcome by our partner south of the border\".

Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck.ATLANTA (AP) — Democratic presidential candidates clashed in a debate over the future of health care in America, racial inequality and their ability to build a winning coalition to take on President Donald Trump next year. The Wednesday night faceoff came after hours of testimony in the impeachment inquiry of Trump and at a critical juncture in the Democratic race to run against him in 2020. With less than three months before the first voting contests, big questions hang over the front-runners, time is running out for lower tier candidates to make their move and new Democrats are launching improbable last-minute bids for the nomination. But amid the turbulence, the White House hopefuls often found themselves fighting on well-trodden terrain, particularly over whether the party should embrace a sweeping \"Medicare for All\" program or make more modest changes to the current health care system. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the field\\'s most progressive voices, staunchly defended Medicare for All, which would eliminate private insurance coverage in favor of a government-run system. \"The American people understand that the current health care system is not only cruel — it is dysfunctional,\" Sanders said. Former Vice President Joe Biden countered that many people are happy with private insurance through their jobs, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, complained about other candidates seeking to take \"the divisive step\" of ordering people onto universal health care, \"whether they like it or not\". Democrats successfully campaigned on health care last year, winning control of the House on a message that Republicans were slashing existing benefits. But moderates worry that Medicare for All is more complicated and may not pay the same political dividend. That\\'s especially true after Democrats won elections earlier this month in Kentucky and Virginia without embracing the program. \"We must get our fired-up Democratic base with us,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. \"But let\\'s also get those independents and moderate Republicans who cannot stomach (Trump) anymore\". The fifth Democratic debate unfolded in Atlanta, a city that played a central role in the civil rights movement, and the party\\'s diversity, including two African American candidates, was on display. But there was disagreement on how best to appeal to minority voters, who are vital to winning the Democratic nomination and will be crucial in the general election. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey said the party has sometimes come up short in its outreach to black Americans. \"For too long, I think, candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been a backbone of the Democratic Party,\" Harris said. \"You show up in a black church and want to get the vote but just haven\\'t been there before\". Booker declared, \"Black voters are pissed off, and they\\'re worried\". In the moderators\\' chairs were four women, including Rachel Maddow, MSNBC\\'s liberal darling, and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post. It was only the third time a primary debate has been hosted by an all-female panel. Buttigieg — who was a natural target given his recent rise in the polls to join Biden, Warren and Sanders among the crowded field\\'s front-runners — was asked early about how being mayor of a city of 100,000 residents qualified him for the White House. \"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small,\" Buttigieg said. \"But frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small\". Klobuchar argued that she has more experience enacting legislation and suggested that women in politics are held to a higher standard. \"Otherwise we could play a game called \\'Name your favorite woman president,\\' which we can\\'t do because it has all been men,\" she said. Another memorable exchange occurred when Biden — who didn\\'t face any real attacks from his rivals — was asked about curbing violence against women and responded awkwardly. \"We have to just change the culture,\" he said. \"And keep punching at it. And punching at it. And punching at it\". Harris scrapped with another low polling candidate: Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who has criticized prominent Democrats, including 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton. \"I think that it\\'s unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the Democratic nominee for the president of the United States who during the Obama administration spent four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama,\" Harris said. \"I\\'m not going to put party interests first,\" Gabbard responded. But the discussion kept finding its way back to Medicare for All, which has dominated the primary — especially for Warren. She released plans to raise $20-plus trillion in new government revenue for universal health care. But she also said implementation of the program may take three years — drawing criticism both from moderates like Biden and Buttigieg, who think she\\'s trying to distance herself from an unpopular idea, and Sanders supporters, who see the Massachusetts senator\\'s commitment to Medicare for All wavering. Sanders made a point of saying Wednesday that he\\'d send Medicare for All legislation to Congress during the first week of his administration. Booker faced especially intense pressure Wednesday since he\\'s yet to meet the Democratic National Committee\\'s polling requirements for the December debate in California. He spent several minutes arguing with Warren about the need to more appropriately tax the wealthy, but also called for \"building wealth\" among people of color and other marginalized communities. \"We\\'ve got to start empowering people,\" Booker said. Businessman Andrew Yang was asked what he would say to Russian President Vladimir Putin if he got the chance — and joked about that leader\\'s cordial relationship with Trump. \"First of all, I\\'d say I\\'m sorry I beat your guy,\" Yang said with a grin, drawing howls of laughter from the audience.

Dozens of children and young adults have been diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and other forms of cancer in a four-county area outside Pittsburgh, where energy companies have drilled more than 3,500 wells since 2008. Ewing has no known environmental cause, and gas industry officials say there is no evidence linking pediatric cancer to drilling. But the families nevertheless suspect that drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the method that energy companies use to extract natural gas from shale rock, played a role. They have been pressing the Wolf administration for an investigation into any possible link between this extremely rare form of bone cancer and shale gas development — and confronted Wolf himself at the Capitol on Monday. \"I want to thank the families that have shared their heartbreaking stories,\" the Democratic governor said in a statement Friday. \"I understand and support the concerns of parents and desire of community members to learn more about the possible reasons for these cancer cases\". The research, he said, is meant to address \"the concern that there is a relationship between hydraulic fracturing and childhood cancers\". One study will use existing research that linked natural gas activity to medical conditions like asthma and, applying the same methodology, try to replicate those earlier findings in the population in southwestern Pennsylvania. The other study will focus specifically on rare childhood cancers, including Ewing sarcoma, with researchers looking at whether these young cancer patients were exposed to fracking more often than a control population. \"We\\'re very happy to hear this. We feel as though our voices have been heard and hopefully, through the research, maybe they will come up with some answers to these mysterious rare cancers,\" said Christine Barton, whose 22-year-old son, Mitch, has been battling Ewing sarcoma for nearly a year. She said the family lives within two miles of four well pads, with the closest one a half-mile down the road. In a joint statement Friday, three gas industry groups said they support Wolf\\'s efforts to get to the bottom of the pediatric cancer cases, noting: \"The concerns in these communities are shared with our industry. We live here too and have no higher priority than protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our communities, especially our kids and grandkids\". The industry groups also called on state officials to \"neutrally, fairly and without bias evaluate all potential factors\". Each study is projected to last three years. The state is seeking to partner on them with an academic research institution. Friday\\'s announcement came after residents and activists had expressed anger and frustration over the state Department of Health\\'s handling of the pediatric cancer crisis. The health department concluded this year that the cancer cases did not meet the technical definition of a cluster, a finding that was greeted with skepticism by activists and residents who said the agency failed to include some cases in its study. Residents blasted health officials at an October information session at Canon-McMillan High School, in a district where there\\'s been a half-dozen cases of Ewing sarcoma. On Friday, Janice Blanock, whose 19-year-old son, Luke Blanock, died of Ewing in 2016, said she was ecstatic over the new research funding. \"This is a giant positive step, and I think they\\'re finally taking it serious and really understanding where we\\'re coming from,\" she said.SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Around 1,000 people protested outside a government building in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo after an opposition lawmaker published shocking photos of special needs children tied to beds and radiators in a nearby government facility. The protest included scores of parents and relatives of children with disabilities, who vividly described a dysfunctional care system that condemns their kids to suffering. Sabina Sunic, who has a 17-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, voiced the fears of many parents. \"When we die there is no system, they will tie up all our children,\" she said. Sunic said her daughter is \"very happy and accomplished,\" but only because she is being cared for by her parents who, like everyone else in their situation, receive no assistance from the government. The protest came a day after lawmaker Sabina Cudic of the opposition Nasa Stranka party publicly shared the disturbing photos from the Pazaric care home, outside Sarajevo, and demanded that they be debated in the parliament. \"This is not a shock to the government, there is a long line of documented, systemic abuse of funds and the patients,\" Cudic told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Just two months ago, they made a very explicit statement that they are very satisfied with the conditions in Pazaric\". The Pazaric care home, which has 149 employees, 27 of whom are economists, is already being investigated after a new manager, who took over last spring, warned authorities of alleged corruption by his predecessor. Cudic said an official report by Bosnia\\'s tax authority, presented to the government over a month ago, documented a high degree of wrongdoing at the care home. Aside from questions of financial mismanagement, the home has faced fierce criticism for the level of care provided. According to Cudic, the home did not have a professional therapist until a year ago and the night shift was covered by only one untrained individual. \"I could give proper care and compassion to the children in Pazaric, but while I am trained, I am not (politically) suitable,\" said Nikolina Toljagic, an unemployed social worker who joined Thursday\\'s protest. Cudic\\'s initiative for an emergency debate was rejected, prompting thousands of Bosnians to publish the names of the lawmakers who refused to debate Cudic\\'s claims on social networks in an apparent attempt to shame them. \"The government perceives the institutions (for special needs children) as a profit-making solution,\" said a visibly shaken Aida Hrnjic, who is raising her 7-year-old autistic son at home. \"It is very obvious that they do not care about children\". On Thursday, the European Union\\'s office in Bosnia issued a statement describing the published photos as shocking and appalling. It called on authorities \"to thoroughly investigate these allegations immediately and to ensure swift and proper institutional follow up\". More protests have been called for Friday.FULTON, Mo. (AP) — A central Missouri couple responsible for the care of a developmentally disabled man whose body was found entombed in concrete admitted Friday that they did not seek proper medical care for him when they knew his health was deteriorating and then lied about his death. Sherry Paulo, 54, and her 59-year-old husband, Anthony Flores, both of Fulton, pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal civil rights charges arising from the death of Carl DeBrodie, whose body was found in April 2017 after he was reported missing from a supported living home in Fulton. They pleaded guilty to failing to provide necessary care for DeBrodie, resulting in his injury and death. Paulo also pleaded guilty to health care fraud for trying to hide that DeBrodie had died. They still face state charges in DeBrodie\\'s death, including first-degree involuntary manslaughter and abandonment of a corpse. The couple were caregivers at Second Chance Homes, which provided housing and care for developmentally disabled individuals. DeBrodie lived at the home from 2008 until he was reported missing. As part of their plea, Paulo and Flores admitted they knew DeBrodie\\'s health was declining beginning in 2014, when he became seriously underweight and pale. During that time, he sometimes stayed at the couple\\'s home. Prosecutors said DeBrodie at one point suffered a medical emergency at the couple\\'s home, but the couple did not seek medical help for him and he died there. Paulo admitted that she placed DeBrodie\\'s body in a trashcan and took it to Second Chance, where she and Flores put it in a wooden crate and filled the crate with cement. The crate was then taken to Paulo\\'s storage unit. DeBrodie was reported missing on April 17, 2017 and his body was found a week later. DeBrodie\\'s mother, Carolyn Summers, said in a wrongful death lawsuit that her son was forced to fight another man for the \"amusement\" of people at the couple\\'s home and was left to die in a bathtub. She said government agencies responsible for her son didn\\'t provide required care and didn\\'t check on DeBrodie for months. The lawsuit was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. Paulo admitted that after she reported DeBrodie missing, she and Flores told police DeBrodie was alive and well. She also admitted that she continued to submit claims to Medicaid for DeBrodie\\'s care after she knew he was dead. Medicaid wrongfully paid about $106,795 between September 2016 — when DeBrodie is believed to have died — and April 2017. Paulo faces a maximum of 17.5 years in prison and Flores faces up to about 15.5 years in prison. \"They were responsible to provide care to a vulnerable victim, but today admitted they ignored obvious signs of medical distress and failed to even call 911. Instead, they hid him away in their unfinished basement until he died,\" U.S. Attorney Tim Garrison of the Western District of Missouri said in a statement. \"They may have thought they could hide the body in a concrete-filled crate and get away with it. But when the civil rights of a vulnerable victim are violated, we will hold them accountable for their inhumane and criminal conduct\". A nurse who was supposed to provide care for DeBrodie and two other employees of the Second Chance home have pleaded guilty to their roles in his death or the coverup.CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE).

Elysium Health, Inc.,™ a life sciences company developing clinically validated health products based on advancements in scientific research, today announced the completion of enrollment for a clinical trial to explore the effect of Basis™ on liver fat accumulation in healthy adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). NAFL is a precondition that affects approximately 80–100 million Americans that currently has no treatment—as the name suggests, the main characteristic is an accumulation of fat stored in the liver. While NAFL is not a disease, the current obesity epidemic is paralleled by manifestations of metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, increased waist circumference, and hypertriglyceridemia. All of these biomarkers are also conditions that are associated with excessive accumulation of liver fat, indicating that fatty liver may be regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Basis is a combination of Elysium Health\\'s proprietary nicotinamide riboside (NR) and pterostilbene (PT), which is designed to increase NAD+ levels and activate sirtuins. As an essential coenzyme involved in hundreds of metabolic processes, NAD+ has a critical role in the conversion of NAD+ to NADH for mitochondrial metabolism and the resulting synthesis of ATP, which is how cells create energy. The activation of sirtuins – which are NAD-dependent – also regulates important physiological processes like lipid metabolism. In an earlier clinical trial, Basis was shown to increase and sustain NAD+ levels on average by 40% from baseline. \"There is evidence to show that people with fat accumulating in their liver exhibit lower levels of hepatic NAD+ and a lower ratio of NAD+: NADH,\" said Dr. Oliver Chen, who is the principal investigator for the study, principal scientist at Biofortis, Mérieux NutriSciences, and an adjunct associate professor in the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. \"With this study, we are examining whether increased circulating levels of NAD+ will result in an enhancement of cellular metabolism and an increase in oxidation of hepatic fat. In animal studies, supplementation with NR has resulted in an increase in circulating NAD+ levels, a reduction in the fat content of the liver, and improved mitochondrial function, among other benefits. In addition to enhancing NAD+ levels, identifying novel activators of sirtuins may provide benefits for people with fat accumulation in their liver. In animal and in vitro human cell culture studies, PT has been shown to exhibit myriad positive effects, including antioxidant as well as hepatoprotective effects on experimental liver fibrosis, such that researchers have suggested that it may have \"pleiotropic health applications.\\'\". \"While culturally we are very focused on fat reduction, fat is not necessarily problematic when it\\'s contained in fat cells and stored where it should be,\" said Elysium Health chief scientist and director of the Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at MIT Dr. Leonard Guarente. \"It becomes problematic, however, when it circulates throughout the body and accumulates inappropriately in organs where it has the potential to impede their functions. If you\\'re able to demonstrate a reduction of fat in the liver, you should not only benefit that organ but also likely reduce inappropriate fat and exert a positive effect elsewhere in the body. You wouldn\\'t necessarily expect to observe weight loss, but may expect to find other health benefits, which would be a highly significant advancement at a time of a debilitating obesity epidemic\". One hundred and eleven healthy adults with NAFL ages 18–70 have been enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, which will compare the effects of two doses of Basis to a matching placebo over the course of a 26-week treatment period. The study is scheduled to complete in April 2020, and more information can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT03513523. About Elysium Health™.

SOURCE Elysium Health.PABLO, Mont. (AP) — Attorney General William Barr announced a nationwide plan Friday to address the crisis of missing and slain Native American women as concerns mount over the level of violence they face. Barr announced the plan, known as the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Initiative, during a visit with tribal leaders and law enforcement officials on the Flathead Reservation in Montana. Native American women experience some of the nation\\'s highest rates of murder, sexual violence and domestic abuse. The National Institute of Justice estimates that 1.5 million Native American women have experienced violence in their lifetime, including many who are victims of sexual violence. On some reservations, federal studies have shown women are killed at a rate more than 10 times the national average. The Justice Department\\'s new initiative would invest $1.5 million to hire specialized coordinators in 11 U.S. attorney\\'s offices across the U.S. with significant Indian Country caseloads. The coordinators would be responsible for developing protocols for a better law enforcement response to missing persons cases. Montana\\'s coordinator, a former FBI agent, already has started in his position. Tribal or local law enforcement officials would also be able to call on the FBI for additional help in some missing indigenous persons cases. The FBI could then deploy some of its specialized teams, including investigators who focus on child abduction or evidence collection and special agents who can help do a quick analysis of digital evidence and social media accounts. The Justice Department also committed to conducting an in-depth analysis of federal databases and its data collection practices to determine if there are ways to improve the gathering of information in missing persons cases. \"This is not a panacea,\" Barr told tribal council members of the Salish and Kootenai Confederated Tribes at an event where members presented him with a blue blanket before a traditional musical performance. \"This is a step in the right direction, but we have a lot more work to do working together\". Barr said he spoke to President Donald Trump about the initiative, which calls for some of the same things already in legislation pending in Congress. He also spoke to tribal leaders about how a surge in methamphetamine use may be influencing violence in Indian Country. On the nation\\'s largest Native American reservation, tribal members welcomed the extra resources and commitment to the issue but questioned how far the money will go, given how widespread the problem is. \"This is stuff we\\'ve been advocating for, it\\'s just funding a slice of it,\" said Amber Crotty, a lawmaker on the Navajo Nation. Crotty pointed out that the hiring of 11 coordinators assigned to federal prosecutor offices nationally as outlined by Barr could have limited value on the Navajo Nation, which is part of three separate U.S. attorney jurisdictions in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. She said tribes are looking to the federal government to fund advocates who can greet families of victims, relay information from law enforcement and provide training. She said tribal communities have resorted to organizing their own search parties and posting fliers in communities and on social media when someone goes missing because they sometimes get little or no response from law enforcement. The extent of the problem of missing and murdered Native American women is difficult to know because of the dysfunction surrounding the issue. An Associated Press investigation last year found that nobody knows precisely how many Native American women have gone missing or have been killed nationwide because many cases go unreported, others aren\\'t well documented, and no government database specifically tracks them. A report released last year by the Urban Indian Health Institute said there were 5,712 cases of missing and murdered indigenous girls in 2016, but only 116 of those cases were logged in a Justice Department database. That study is limited in scope, however. The report by the Seattle nonprofit reflected data from 71 U.S. cities not on tribal land. Researchers said they expect their figures represent an undercount because some police departments in cities with substantial Native American populations — like Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Billings, Montana — didn\\'t respond to records requests or Native Americans were identified as belonging to another race. Members of Congress asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office in May to review jurisdictional challenges, existing databases, federal policies, law enforcement staffing and notification systems and make recommendations for improvement. The office said Thursday the work is under way. Bills in Congress seek to address the crisis, and a half-dozen states have vowed to study the problem. Meanwhile, activists have held rallies at state capitols, marched in the streets, put up memorials and billboards, bought television advertising and created exhibits with space for prayer offerings to draw attention to missing indigenous women. The movement has featured women with a red hand print over their mouths, in what activists say is a symbol of the silencing of indigenous women. Curtison Badonie with the New Mexico-based Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women said the Justice Department\\'s plan is a positive move in seeking justice for indigenous women and girls, and their grieving families and communities. \"Finally, they\\'re moving forward with this and they\\'re taking our existence seriously and are listening and knowing our sisters, our aunties, our grandmas, our nieces are important,\" Badonie said. \"They are sacred, they are human beings. We feel hopeful. We feel seen\". But Badonie said: \"We want to see that this continues, that this is not going to be just a one-time thing\". Tribal police and investigators from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs generally serve as law enforcement on reservations, which are sovereign nations. But the FBI investigates certain offenses if either the suspect, victim or both are Native American. If there\\'s ample evidence, the Justice Department prosecutes major felonies such as murder, kidnapping and rape if they happen on tribal lands. Fonseca reported from Flagstaff, Arizona.More college students are turning to their schools for help with anxiety, depression and other mental health problems, and many must wait weeks for treatment or find help elsewhere as campus clinics struggle to meet demand, an Associated Press review of more than three dozen public universities found. On some campuses, the number of students seeking treatment has nearly doubled over the last five years while overall enrollment has remained relatively flat. The increase has been tied to reduced stigma around mental health, along with rising rates of depression and other disorders. Universities have expanded their mental health clinics, but the growth is often slow, and demand keeps surging. Long waits have provoked protests at schools from Maryland to California, in some cases following student suicides. Meanwhile, campus counseling centers grapple with low morale and high burnout as staff members face increasingly heavy workloads. \"It\\'s an incredible struggle, to be honest,\" said Jamie Davidson, associate vice president for student wellness at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which has 11 licensed counselors for 30,000 students. \"It\\'s stressful on our staff and our resources. We\\'ve increased it, but you\\'re never going to talk to anyone in the mental health field who tells you we have sufficient resources\". The Associated Press requested five years of data from the largest public university in each state. A total of 39 provided annual statistics from their counseling clinics or health centers. The remaining 11 said they did not have complete records or had not provided records five months after they were requested. The data shows that most universities are working to scale up their services, but many are far outpaced by demand. Since 2014, the number of students receiving mental health treatment at those schools has grown by 35%, while total enrollment grew just 5%. By last year, nearly 1 in 10 students were coming for help, but the number of licensed counselors changed little, from an average of 16 to 19 over five years. On some campuses, that amounts to one counselor for every 4,000 students, including at Utah Valley University. An industry accrediting group suggests a minimum of one counselor per 1,500 students, but few of the 39 universities met that benchmark. When Ashtyn Aure checked in at the mental health clinic at Utah Valley last year, she was suffering anxiety attacks and had not slept for days. Her mind kept returning to past traumas. When she asked to see a counselor, a staff member told her the wait list stretched for months. She left without getting help. \"I was so obviously distressed, and that was the place I was supposed to go. What do you do after that? Do you go to the hospital? Do you phone a friend?\" said Aure, 25, who graduated this year. Ultimately, she turned to her church, which helped her find therapy at an outside clinic. \"If it wasn\\'t for that,\" she said, \"I don\\'t know\". Officials at Utah Valley said they are working to avoid such cases. If staff know a student is in crisis, they said, a counselor can see that person in a matter of minutes. But staff members have only a few moments to make an assessment. \"Unfortunately, stories like this are not that uncommon,\" said Dr. William Erb, senior director of student health services at Utah Valley. \"We train, review and revise these procedures so that situations like this can be avoided as much as possible\". At most universities, students contemplating suicide or otherwise in crisis are offered help right away. Others are asked to schedule an appointment. For cases that are not urgent, the wait can range from hours to months, depending on the time of year and the design of the clinic. Many schools that provided data to the AP said it takes weeks to get an initial appointment. At Utah Valley, students waited an average of more than four weeks last year. At the University of Washington at Seattle, it was three weeks. During busy times at Louisiana State, wait times stretched to four or five weeks. Some other schools have adopted a model that provides screenings the same day students ask for help, but it can take weeks to get further treatment. To some students, waiting is just an inconvenience. But it raises the risk that some young people will forgo help entirely, potentially allowing their problems to snowball. Students at Brigham Young University drew attention to delays last year after a student took her own life on campus. Days after the suicide, an anonymous letter was posted at the counseling center describing the dilemma some students face. \"I have a therapist on campus, and he is wonderful and well qualified. But I only see him once a month. Because he has too many clients to see in one week,\" the letter said. \"It is the story of many of us barely getting by here at BYU. If I died would anything change?\". Students at the University of Maryland called for change last year after some on campus said they had to wait 30 days or more for an initial appointment. Organizers called the campaign \"30 Days Too Late\". \"We quickly realized that there were a lot of people on campus who believed in what we were doing and had had their own experiences,\" said Garrett Mogge, a junior who helped organize the effort. \"Thirty days can be a long time. And once you get there, it\\'s too late for some people\". Officials at the University of Maryland said the campaign showed there was a need to raise awareness about same-day crisis services available on campus. The school also has hired additional counselors since the campaign began. Other schools that have received student petitions to improve counseling include Michigan State, Louisiana State, Columbia and Cornell universities. For cases that are not urgent, some argue that waiting isn\\'t necessarily bad — and could even lead to better outcomes. A recent study found greater reductions in anxiety and depression at clinics that focus on providing students counseling at regular intervals, a system that might mean waiting for a therapist\\'s caseload to open. That practice was compared with clinics that offer quick initial help but cannot always provide routine follow-up treatment. The study by Pennsylvania State University\\'s Center for Collegiate Mental Health found that prioritizing access over treatment \"may have significant negative consequences for students in need\". The rising demand for campus mental health care has been attributed to an array of factors. Stigma around the issue has faded, encouraging more students to get help. Disorders that once prevented students from going to college are no longer seen as a barrier. Some people believe social media fuels anxiety, while others say today\\'s students simply have more trouble coping with stress. Mass shootings, and the fear they spread, have also been suggested as a factor. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, saw an increase in demand following a 2017 shooting at a nearby county music festival that left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded. \"That really increased the number of students we were seeing,\" said Davidson, the head of student wellness. The school later hired a trauma specialist and added a student mental health fee to hire more counselors, among other measures to reduce wait times. For years, national surveys have found rising rates of anxiety and depression among college students. Most colleges that provided data to the AP said those conditions, and stress, were the most common complaints. Some schools also have seen more students struggling with thoughts of suicide. The shifting landscape has spurred many universities to rethink how they provide help, including offering more short-term treatment options. More students are being steered to group therapy or anxiety workshops. Counseling centers offer yoga, and many train students to counsel one another. \"We\\'re reframing what mental health looks like at a school. It\\'s not necessarily 10 therapists sitting in offices,\" said Erb, the student health director at Utah Valley. Rising demand has also opened doors for businesses promising solutions. Some schools have signed on with companies that provide therapy over the phone or through video chats. Others urge students to try smartphone apps. But some say the changes will help little if clinics remain understaffed. Counselors at some California State University campuses are pressing the system to hire more staff even as it expands peer counseling programs and wellness workshops. A faculty union is lobbying to reach a ratio of one counselor for every 1,500 students. The system estimates it has one for every 2,700 students. \"Some students come in, and they can be seen maybe once every five or six weeks. They are shocked, because that\\'s not what they\\'re used to out in the real world,\" said Martha Cuan, a counselor at Stanislaus State University, one of the system\\'s 23 campuses. A state bill requiring the system to set a goal to meet the lower ratio failed to gain traction in the state Legislature this year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it next year. Other states tackling the issue include Illinois, which in August approved a law telling public universities to aim for one counselor per 1,250 students. For many schools, finding the money to add counselors is a challenge. Many campus clinics don\\'t charge students for services and generate little or no revenue. A 2016 bill in Congress proposed new grants for university counseling, but it never advanced to a vote. Some schools are adding new campus fees to hire counselors or are subsidizing clinics through athletics revenue, as the University of Texas recently did. Overall, the AP analysis found that campus counseling budgets have increased by about 25% over the last five years, but levels vary widely, from more than $200 per student at some campuses to less than $40 at others. The way students feel about campus mental health services is mixed, according to a recent poll by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Among adults ages 18 through 29 who have pursued higher education, about a third said colleges do a good job handling mental health needs, while about as many said they think schools do a bad job. Another 3 in 10 said it\\'s neither good nor bad. Most university presidents say mental health is a growing concern, but they lack the tools to address it, according to a separate survey of school chiefs by the American Council on Education. Given unlimited funding, the survey found, most presidents said they would first hire more mental health staff. On any campus, the greatest fear is that a student in dire need could fall through the cracks. Mike and Kim Predmore believe that\\'s what happened to their son, Chris, who was struggling as a freshman at Illinois State University in 2014. He had just been through a bad breakup. He didn\\'t make the soccer team. He was stressed about school and wasn\\'t sleeping. One night, he texted a friend and talked about suicide. His family persuaded him to visit the campus counseling center for help. At an initial screening, Chris Predmore told a counselor he was not thinking about suicide but wanted to try therapy, according to notes from the visit. He was told that there was a wait on campus and that he should explore nearby clinics with his parents. He never did. Two days later, he took his own life. His parents have since become regulars at a support group for families of suicide victims. Three other couples in the group also lost children who were in college. The Predmores wonder why there aren\\'t more counselors and why schools can\\'t do more. Often, they just wonder what might have been. \"I think if they would have said, \\'Yeah, we\\'re going to get you into counseling,\\' I don\\'t think he\\'d be dead,\" Kim Predmore said. \"I don\\'t know. I\\'ll never know. But I think he would have been able to hang on\". Collin Binkley can be reached on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley.NEW YORK (AP) — Speaking from the Senate floor for the first time, Kamala Harris expressed gratitude for a woman on whose shoulders she said she stood. In her autobiography, Harris interspersed the well-worn details of her resume with an extended ode to the one she calls \"the reason for everything\". And taking the stage to announce her presidential candidacy , she framed it as a race grounded in the compassion and values of the person she credits for her fighting spirit. Though a decade has passed since Shyamala Gopalan died, she remains a force in her daughter\\'s life and her White House bid. Again and again in the campaign, those who gather around the California senator are hearing mention of the diminutive Indian immigrant the candidate calls her single greatest influence. \"She\\'s always told the same story,\" says friend Mimi Silbert. \"Kamala had one important role model, and it was her mother\". Her mother gave her an early grounding in the civil rights movement and injected in her a duty not to complain but rather to act. And that no-nonsense demeanor on display in Senate hearings over special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and more? Onlookers can credit, or blame, Gopalan, a crusader who raised her daughter in the same mold. Appearing in New York recently, Harris said there were two reasons she was running for president. The first, she said, was a sense of duty to restore truth in justice in the country at an inflection point in history. The second: a mother who responded to gripes with a challenge. \"She\\'d say, \\'Well, what are you going to do about it?\\'\" Harris told the crowd. \"So I decided to run for president of the United States\". Harris\\' parents met as doctoral students at the University of California, Berkeley at the dawn of the 1960s. Her father, a Jamaican named Donald Harris, came to study economics. Her mother studied nutrition and endocrinology. For two freethinking young people drawn to activism, they landed on campus from opposite sides of the world just as protests exploded around civil rights, the Vietnam War and voting rights. Their paths crossed in those movements, and they fell in love. At the heart of their activism was a small group of students who met every Sunday to discuss the books of black authors and grassroots activity around the world, from the anti-apartheid Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa to liberation movements in Latin America to the black separatist preaching of Malcolm X in the U.S. A member of the group, Aubrey Labrie, says the weekly gathering was one in which figures such as Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro were admired, and would later provide some inspiration to the founders of the Black Panther Party. Gopalan was the only one in the group who wasn\\'t black, but she immersed herself in the issues, Labrie says. She and Harris wowed him with their intellect. \"I was in awe of the knowledge that they seemed to demonstrate,\" said Labrie, who grew so close to the family that the senator calls him \"Uncle Aubrey\". The couple married, and Gopalan Harris gave birth to Kamala and then Maya two years later. Even with young children, the duo continued their advocacy. As a little girl, Harris says she remembers an energetic sea of moving legs and the cacophony of chants as her parents made their way to marches. She writes of her parents being sprayed with police hoses, confronted by Hells Angels and once, with the future senator in a stroller, forced to run to safety when violence broke out. Sharon McGaffie, a family friend whose mother, Regina Shelton, was a caregiver for the girls, remembers Gopalan Harris speaking to her daughters as if they were adults and exposing them to worlds often walled off to children, whether a civil rights march or a visit to mom\\'s laboratory or a seminar where the mother was delivering a speech. \"She would take the girls and they would pull out their little backpacks and they would be in that environment,\" says McGaffie. A few years into the marriage, Harris\\' parents divorced. The senator gives the pain of the parting only a few words in her biography. Those who are close to her describe her childhood as happy, the smells of her mother\\'s cooking filling the kitchen and the sound of constant chatter and laughter buffeting the air. The mother\\'s influence on her girls grew even greater, and friends of Harris say they see it reflected throughout her life. As a kindergartner, Stacey Johnson-Batiste remembers Harris coming to her aid when a classroom bully grabbed her craft project and threw it to the floor, which brought retaliation from the boy. He hit the future politician in the head with something that caused enough bleeding to necessitate a hospital visit, cementing for Johnson-Batiste a lifelong friendship with Harris and a view of her as a woman who embodies the ethics of her mother. \"Even back then,\" Johnson-Batiste says, \"she has always stood up for what she thought was right\". As a teenager, after her mother got a job that prompted a family move to Montreal, Harris began seeing how she could achieve change in ways small and large. Outside her family\\'s apartment, she and her sister protested a prohibition against soccer on the building\\'s lawn, which Harris says resulted in the rule being overturned. As high school wound down, she homed in on a career goal of being a lawyer. Sophie Maxwell, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, says Harris wasn\\'t choosing to eschew activism but rather to incorporate it into a life in law: \"Those two things go hand in hand\". In college, at the historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C., Shelley Young Thompkins recalls a classmate who was certain of what she wanted to do in life, who was serious about her studies and who put off the fun of joining a sorority until her final year even as she made time for sit-ins and protests. Thompkins and Harris both won student council posts. In her new friend, Young Thompkins saw a young woman intent on not squandering all that her mother had worked to give her. \"We were these two freshmen girls who want to save the world,\" she says. From there, Harris\\' story is much better known: a return to California for law school; a failed first attempt at the bar; jobs in prosecutor\\'s offices in Oakland and San Francisco; a brazen and successful run at unseating her former boss as district attorney; election as state attorney general and U.S. senator; and her run for president. Each step of the way, friends point to the influence of Gopalan Harris as a constant. Andrea Dew Steele remembers it being apparent from the moment they sat down to craft the very first flyer for Harris\\' first campaign for public office. \"She always talked about her mother,\" Dew Steele says. \"When she was alive she was a force, and since she\\'s passed away she\\'s still a force\". Dew Steele remembers when she finally met Gopalan Harris at a campaign event. It immediately struck her: \"Oh, this is where Kamala gets it from\". As much as mother and daughter shared, Gopalan Harris believed the world would see them differently. Those who knew her say she was dismayed by racial inequality in the U.S. Understanding her girls would be seen as black despite their mixed heritage, she surrounded them with black role models and immersed them in black culture. They sang in the children\\'s choir at a black church and regularly visited Rainbow Sign, a former Berkeley funeral home that was transformed into a vibrant black cultural center. Though the senator talks of attending anti-apartheid protests in college and frames her life story as being in the same mold as her mother, she opted to pursue change by seeking a seat at the table. \"I knew part of making change was what I\\'d seen all my life, surrounded by adults shouting and marching and demanding justice from the outside. But I also knew there was an important role on the inside,\" she wrote in \"The Truths We Hold\". To launch her political career, Harris had to unseat a man of her mother\\'s generation — a liberal prosecutor who was the product of a left-wing family, who was active in the civil rights movement and who became a hero to other activists whom he defended in court. To win, Harris ran as a tougher-on-crime alternative. Once in office, bound by the parameters of the law and the realities of politics, Harris\\' choices stirred some to dismiss her claims of progressivism even as many others fiercely defend her. She frames her philosophy in the example of her mother — concentrating on overarching goals through smaller daily steps. \"She wasn\\'t fixated on that distant dream. She focused on the work right in front of her,\" the senator wrote. Gopalan Harris defied generations of tradition by not returning to southern India after getting her doctorate, tossing aside expectations of an arranged marriage. Her daughter portrays her mother\\'s spirit of activism as being in her blood. Gopalan Harris\\' mother took in victims of domestic abuse and educated women about contraception. Her father was active in India\\'s independence movement and became a diplomat. The couple spent time living in Zambia after the end of British rule there, working to settle refugees. Joe Gray, who was Gopalan Harris\\' boss after she returned from Canada to the Bay Area to work at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, struggles to describe how a 5-foot-1-inch woman managed to fill a room with her commanding presence. Gray, now a professor at Oregon Health and Science University, didn\\'t see Gopalan Harris as a \"crusader in the workplace\" but says she insisted on racial and gender equity, would make known her disapproval to an insensitive comment and was assertive in defending her work in cancer research. Even from a distance, he\\'s struck by how much Harris reminds him of her. \"I just get the TV persona, but a lot of Shyamala\\'s directness and sense of social justice, those seem to come through,\" he says. \"I sense the same spirit\". Lateefah Simon sensed it, too. She was a high school dropout-turned-MacArthur fellow Harris hired to join the San Francisco DA\\'s office to head a program for first-time offenders. Simon was skeptical of taking a role in a criminal justice system she saw as broken and biased, but Harris impressed her, and soon she had a glimpse of her mother as well. At campaign events, Simon would watch Gopalan Harris, always in the front row, always beaming with pride. She saw how both mother and daughter were meticulous about tiny details, how they were hard workers but maintained a sense of joy in the labors, how their laugh would echo in the room. One time, Simon says Gopalan Harris sent her away from a fundraiser because she was wearing tennis shoes, gently reminding her, \"We always show up excellent\". Years later, she heard echoes of the same message when Harris took a break from her Senate race to support her run for a seat on the Bay Area Rapid Transit District board. Descending from her campaign bus, Harris was quick with some words of advice for her friend: \"Girl, clean your glasses\". \"It\\'s her saying, \\'I believe in you and I want people to see what I see in you,\\'\" Simon says. Remembering her brush with the senator\\'s mother, Simon says: \"If I got that from Shyamala just in that one moment, can you imagine the many jewels Kamala got from her growing up?\". It\\'s an influence that far outweighed that of Harris\\' father. He and her mother separated when she was 5 before ultimately divorcing. She writes of seeing him on weekends and over summers after he became a professor at Stanford University. In a piece he wrote for the Jamaica Global website, Harris says he never gave up his love for his daughters, and the senator trumpeted her father as a superhero in her children\\'s book. But the iciness of their relationship was on display in February when she jokingly linked her use of marijuana to her Jamaican heritage. Her father labeled the comment a \"travesty\" and a shameful soiling of the family reputation \"in the pursuit of identity politics\". The senator is curt in responding to questions about him, saying they have \"off and on\" contact and that she doesn\\'t know if he\\'ll have a role in her campaign. Labrie says though the father attended his daughter\\'s Senate swearing-in, he wasn\\'t at her campaign kickoff. He thinks the marijuana hubbub worsened their relationship. \"I think that was the straw that really broke the camel\\'s back,\" he says. The singularity of her mother\\'s role in her life made her death even harder for Harris. Gopalan Harris relished roles in her daughter\\'s early campaigns but was gone before seeing her advance beyond a local office. The senator says she still thinks of her constantly. \"It can still get me choked up,\" she said in an interview. \"It doesn\\'t matter how many years have passed\". The senator still uses pots and wooden spoons of her mother and thinks of her when she is back home and able to cook. Her mother\\'s amethyst ring sparkles from her hand. She finds herself asking her mother for advice or remembering one of her oft-repeated lines. She pictures the pride her mother wore as she stood beside her when she was sworn in as district attorney. She remembers worrying about staying composed as she uttered her mother\\'s name in her inaugural address as attorney general. She thinks of her mother asking a hospice nurse if her daughters would be OK as cancer drew her final day closer. \"There is no title or honor on earth I\\'ll treasure more than to say I am Shyamala Gopalan Harris\\' daughter,\" she wrote. \"That is the truth I hold dearest of all\". Sedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org and https://twitter.com/sedensky.FRANKLIN, N.H. (AP) — Bernie Sanders has consistently remained among the front-runners in the Democratic primary with polling that has stayed strong despite his campaign-trail heart attack last month and the rise of top rivals Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. But perhaps no state will test the Vermont senator\\'s durability more than New Hampshire, where he trounced Hillary Clinton by 22 points in 2016 and now may find himself a victim of that success since repeating such a dominate performance seems unthinkable. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, is trying to erode Sanders\\' support among ardent progressives, while former Vice President Joe Biden continues to woo the Democratic establishment, declaring during a recent stop in the state capital, Concord: \"I plan on winning New Hampshire\". Yet another New Englander, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, could raise the state\\'s stakes since he\\'s already relatively well known here, despite just joining the race. And, with none of those candidates from nearby states running away with New Hampshire, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has moved among the front-runners — similar to his rise in Iowa. \"I like what Bernie stands for,\" said Jessica Pine, 42, who attended a Sanders event Saturday in Franklin and is considering voting for him, Warren or Biden. \"I\\'m not sure about the electability for him\". Polls in late October and early November show Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg all bunched together for the New Hampshire lead, with each seeing about the same level of support from likely primary voters. Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in August he expected Sanders to win New Hampshire — which is expected to hold its primary on Feb. 11, eight days after Iowa\\'s first-in-the-nation caucuses — while insisting that falling short wouldn\\'t spell catastrophe. \"It gets harder if we don\\'t win New Hampshire for sure,\" Shakir said. Still, in September, Sanders ousted his New Hampshire state director, and a top adviser to the campaign in the state also left. On Oct. 1, Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada. Since then, the Sanders campaign has shown more of a New Hampshire presence and announced earlier this month that it had 90 staffers here. Warren has more than 55 staffers statewide, according to a campaign aide. And, though voters at their respective events often name Sanders or Warren as among their top choices, the senators\\' campaign styles are far different. Warren prides herself on the number of \"selfies\" she takes with attendees, with lines snaking throughout venues well after she\\'s finished speaking. Sanders sometimes moves on quickly enough that staffers begin breaking down the site moments after his event concludes — though he held a photo line of his own in Franklin on Saturday. Warren takes questions from the audience via a lottery system. Sanders — when he does opt to take questions — is likely to pepper crowds with more questions even as he provides answers. Sarah Gellert, a 40-year-old teacher, said she voted for Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary but now is undecided between him and Warren. \"I feel for both candidates very deeply and I would love — of course in this la la land world — I\\'d love to see them on the same ticket,\" Gellert said. \"I\\'m really scared for them because they have so much overlap in terms of their voter pool\". As he has elsewhere, Buttigieg has relied on his New Hampshire popularity rising even while still introducing himself to many voters and building out campaign infrastructure. Patrick makes the field even more crowded, but potentially helping to ease some of the logjam is California Sen. Kamala Harris, who spent weeks attracting large New Hampshire crowds only to recently close down her operations here to focus on Iowa. In Franklin, 75-year-old Sanders supporter Lana Kangas asked the senator if in the future he would take more time to show the differences between himself and the other candidates, including Warren. Sanders noted his age, 78 compared to Warren\\'s 70, experience and consistency, but answered, \"I will say without hesitancy that every single Democratic candidate on his or her worst day will be 10 times better\" than President Donald Trump. After waiting to get her photo taken with Sanders, Kangas said she\\'s worried the other Democrats couldn\\'t beat Trump. \"I believe that Bernie is the only one that can galvanize the people, that will rally the people,\" Kangas said. Warren, I believe, will end up like (former President Barack) Obama. He said all the right things, he was for change, he was going to galvanize people to fight for change and when he came into office, he didn\\'t. It was like the whole thing got dropped\".DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — In endorsing Democrat Joe Biden for president on Saturday, former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said, above all, the former vice president\\'s personal losses give him \"the capacity to comfort\" and \"the need to heal\" a divided nation. Vilsack, who served eight years in the Obama administration with Biden as secretary of agriculture, said during a morning rally in Des Moines that Biden could step into the office with an immediate command of domestic and global issues at a time when events demand \"you can\\'t be a rookie in this business. You\\'ve got to be a pro\". More fundamentally, the death of Biden\\'s first wife and infant daughter in a car accident in 1972 and his son Beau\\'s death from cancer in 2015 have given Biden a deep sense of suffering important to understanding the day-to-day struggles, and personal pain, of many Americans. He is \"a man with empathy, and a man who has the heart of a president,\" said Vilsack, who noted Biden\\'s outreach after Vilsack\\'s six-year old granddaughter died in 2017 from complications of influenza. The endorsement comes as Biden has slipped from being the early favorite in Iowa last spring to trailing newcomers, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Biden is embarking on an eight-day bus tour next week, in hopes of sparking momentum with fewer than two months until the caucuses. Vilsack was cheered by the more than 300 who attended the morning rally at an event hall in Des Moines. It\\'s been 18 years since he won reelection, and he remains the only Democrat reelected Iowa governor in more than 50 years. The centrist Midwesterner, who shares Pennsylvania roots with Biden, was twice on Democrats\\' short list for presidential running mate, in 2004 and 2016. Later on Saturday, lamenting the lack of compromise in Washington, Biden criticized Democrats who would circumvent collaboration, and inadvertently overlooked Obama\\'s own moves to get around the Republican-led Congress when he was in office. \"You hear Democrats saying, when I get elected I\\'m going to by executive order do the following,\" Biden told about 100 Democrats in small-town Knoxville. \"Executive orders are basically menus to abuse the power of the presidency\". Obama, whom Biden claims having had a close working relationship with, became prolific in issuing executive orders, in 2014 announcing in frustration, \"I\\'ve got a pen, and I\\'ve got a phone\". Asked by a voter at a campaign stop in Winterset, Iowa, on Friday evening, Biden described several prominent women he\\'d consider, were he to win the 2020 nomination. \"I could start naming people, but the press will think that\\'s who I picked,\" Biden said, noting it was premature. Still, he went on to suggest Stacey Abrams, who ran for Georgia governor last year, calling her \"the woman who should have been the governor of Georgia\". Likewise, he suggested, without giving their names, that he would consider former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and the two senators from New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen. Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \"Ground Game\".NEW YORK (AP) — Back on Brooklyn College\\'s red brick campus this winter to launch his second bid for the White House, Bernie Sanders set aside rhetoric for a few minutes to acknowledge the neighborhood where he grew up. The irascible Vermont senator recalled that his father had come to Brooklyn as an immigrant \"without a nickel in his pocket\". Arguments over money in the family\\'s 3½-room apartment, within walking distance of the campus, taught Sanders early on what it meant to live \"paycheck to paycheck\". \"I know where I came from,\" Sanders told a crowd of supporters, contrasting his New York story with President Donald Trump\\'s privileged upbringing in neighboring Queens, \"and that is something I will never forget\". It was a noteworthy departure for a politician who, for most of his career, has avoided sharing details of his own story, rarely linking policy proposals to his personal experience. But relatives and former classmates who grew up alongside Sanders — and occasionally now Sanders himself — say there are clear connections between the candidate\\'s Brooklyn boyhood and his decades of speeches and legislative proposals aimed at leveling the economic playing field. Not least, they say, was the death of his mother, Dorothy, when Sanders was 18, an event he has rarely done any more than mention. \"I remember my father. came to me and said go downstairs and say goodbye to Aunt Dorothy,\" recalls Sanders\\' cousin, Maxine Glassberg, raised in the same six-story apartment building his family lived in. \"She was in bed, this was the end, and they knew she wasn\\'t coming back\". The death helped shape Sanders\\' views on the need for equal access to health care, the senator said in a recent interview, even as it pushed him to leave Brooklyn for Vermont. \"Losing one\\'s mother at the age of, I believe, 18. was very, very difficult,\" Sanders told The Associated Press. \"In fact, I graduated Madison High School and went to Brooklyn College for one year, and I decided to leave Brooklyn because I kind of wanted to get away from the community that I\\'d grown up in\". The experience is one of the notable parallels between Sanders\\' early life and his politics. When he joined Congress in 1991, the first bill Sanders introduced was an unsuccessful measure to encourage states to institute universal health care. In his latest bid for the White House, the senator has hammered Walmart and other companies to stop paying \"starvation wages\" as he promotes an increase in the federal minimum wage. Sanders, 77, was raised in the close-knit Midwood neighborhood in the years just before and after the Korean War. The area still looks much the same as it did then, with mid-rise art deco apartment buildings, including the one Sanders grew up in, edging Kings Highway and neatly kept houses on side streets. It\\'s a neighborhood of families, despite Brooklyn\\'s current reputation as a denizen for young hipsters. Back then, its residents were mostly secular Jews, along with some families of Italian and Irish ancestry. Today, the neighborhood is home to many Orthodox Jews, with black, Hispanic and Asian households in adjacent blocks. When Sanders was a boy, Midwood was defined by residents\\' awareness of their immigrant roots — and their ethos as middle class and striving. \"Our parents for the most part were American-born, but our grandparents weren\\'t, and we knew what it was to struggle,\" says David Sillen, a neighbor and classmate who walked to school with Sanders every day for years. \"The fact that our parents were more successful than their parents left us with the family construct that we should be more successful than our parents, and that was pretty pervasive\". Sillen and others recall that time fondly, with life shaped by the neighborhood\\'s safety, good schools and middle-class solidity. But Sanders\\' memories are decidedly less rosy. Unlike most of his classmates\\' parents, Sanders\\' father was not American-born. He came to the United States from Poland as a teenager with hardly any money or ability to speak English; many of his relatives were killed in the Holocaust. Sanders said there was little discussion of politics in his home, but his parents talked with their sons about family lost in Nazi death camps. In New York, Eli Sanders became a paint salesman and always had work. But to manage the household on his modest paychecks, Dorothy Sanders, a homemaker, became an uncompromising scrimper and bargain hunter. The senator, who describes his family as \"lower middle class,\" has recalled being scolded for bringing home groceries from a nearby store, rather than one farther away with lower prices. At home, his parents fought frequently about money. \"There were arguments and more arguments between our parents,\" Sanders wrote in \"Our Revolution,\" published after the 2016 election. \"Painful arguments. Arguments that seared through a little boy\\'s brain, never to be forgotten\". Sanders\\' mother, raised in a Bronx family of seven children, had long aspired to more, relatives say. Sanders was reminded of that each time he visited cousin Benjamin Glassberg, whose father\\'s ownership of a garment business afforded a suburban house with a yard on Long Island. Back in Brooklyn, Sanders and his older brother, Larry, slept on a trundle bed in the living room. During reciprocal visits, Glassberg recalls, Sanders\\' mother pushed her sons to work hard in school so they could do better. \"I think she felt at times that possibly it was her fault that they didn\\'t have a more affluent upbringing,\" he says. Sanders alluded to those disappointments in his Brooklyn speech: \"My mother\\'s dream was that someday our family would move out of that rent-controlled apartment to a home of our own. That dream was never fulfilled\". Sanders\\' brother, who has long lived in Britain, did not respond to an interview request. But in a 2015 interview with Vermont Public Radio, Larry Sanders said that while he and his brother had what they needed, hearing their parents constantly argue over money was emotionally taxing. \"I think what Bernard and I took from that is that financial problems are never just financial problems. They enter into people\\'s lives at very deep and personal levels,\" said Larry Sanders, a university lecturer who has been active in Green Party politics in his adopted country. The Sanders brothers both attended James Madison High School, a large, academically rigorous institution that also counts New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and singer Carole King as graduates. Former classmates recall Sanders as a lanky, somewhat reserved young man best known for his talents as a distance runner. \"He was sort of a natural leader among the track team kids. They would ask, \\'What does Bernie think?\\'\" says Walter Block, a former track teammate who is now an economist. Sanders\\' first foray into politics came his senior year, when he was one of three chosen to run for student body president. His platform included a promise to work with classmates to raise money for a Korean child whose parents had been killed in the war. But, as he recalls it, the winner embraced his idea, providing an early lesson in politics. \"It\\'s that good ideas have resonance and other people will often come around to your point of view,\" Sanders said in an interview this month. He went on to raise money by organizing a benefit basketball game between the Madison team and alumni. \"Bernie Sanders made a campaign promise to bring back the stars, and that\\'s exactly what he is doing,\" an article in a 1959 edition of the student newspaper, The Highway, reported. Signing his friend Myron Kalin\\'s yearbook, Sanders wrote that working together to support the Korean orphan had been \"the most gratifying\" thing he\\'d done in high school. Around that time, Dorothy Sanders\\' health began to worsen. Sanders increasingly missed track practice, often showing up to run just before meets, former classmates remember. \"Not that he was ever outgoing,\" Sillen says, \"but he became even more quiet\". Lou Howort, a fellow track team member, recalls that Sanders \"was consumed by his family situation for that year\". Sanders had aspired to go to the University of Chicago after graduation, Howort says, but \"he gave that all up to stay local to be around his mother when she needed him\". Sanders instead enrolled at Brooklyn College, part of New York City\\'s public university network. His mother was hospitalized about two hours away, in southern New Jersey. The hospital, known today as Deborah Heart and Lung Center, started as a tuberculosis sanitorium for poor New Yorkers in the 1920s. The advent of antibiotics kept tuberculosis in check, and the institution remade itself as a specialist in heart treatment, while continuing to provide care without billing patients. Patients were referred mostly by a network of labor organizations and fraternal groups, many of them Jewish, that supported the hospital through donations, spokeswoman Donna McArdle says. Sanders said an uncle helped his mother gain admission. Sanders moved into a Brooklyn attic apartment with Steve Slavin, a fellow Madison graduate, who recalls the two sometimes talking until 4 in the morning. Once he and Sanders spent hours dissecting the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s decision in Marbury v. Madison, a landmark 1803 ruling that established the power of federal courts to review laws and declare them unconstitutional. \"He was interested in these things,\" Slavin says. \"He loved to talk about them\". Slavin says that despite nagging by their landlord to cut the noise, the apartment gave Sanders space to get away from the tensions surrounding his mother\\'s illness. \"He was sort of in denial as to how sick she actually was,\" he says. Sanders moved back home the following semester. A few months later, his mother died and Sanders transferred to the University of Chicago. By the time Sanders graduated in 1964, his father had also passed away and his brother had relocated to England. Without immediate family or a home to go back to, Sanders returned briefly to New York before moving to Vermont. A few years later, Sanders sat down with his cousin, Benjamin Glassberg, to talk about what lay ahead for them. Glassberg says he was surprised when his cousin began talking about making a longshot run on a third-party ticket for one of Vermont\\'s seats in the U.S. Senate. \"Gee Bernie, politics? What interests you in that?\" Glassberg, now 77, recalls asking. \"And he would tell me about his thoughts and the fact that he was very concerned about things such as medical care and. because his mother was ill for that period of time, I could understand where he was coming from\". Sanders says his family\\'s experience finding treatment for his mother helped shape his view that \"health care is a human right — it\\'s not a privilege — and that was not the case back then and that certainly is not the case right now\". Given the era and the generation, it is little surprise that Sanders struck out on his own, former classmates say. \"Most of us couldn\\'t wait to get out of Brooklyn,\" says Sillen, who now lives in Red Bank, New Jersey. \"People didn\\'t want to be their parents. They wanted to be different and to have their own lives\". Sillen and many of his former classmates still keep in contact. A group of men who played basketball at Madison in the 1950s meet regularly in Las Vegas. And this year more than 60 alumni from Sanders\\' graduating class gathered in New York for a reunion. Sanders returned to the school in 2008 when his name was added to its Wall of Distinction, honoring particularly notable alumni. But few were surprised when the candidate sent notice that he would not be attending this time. That\\'s OK, former classmates say, so long as the politician who has distanced himself from Brooklyn remembers the lessons it taught.SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — It was a running joke in his AP U.S. history class at Saint Joseph High School: Would Peter Buttigieg — the smartest kid in class, language whiz and devotee of John F. Kennedy — use his unusual last name in his eventual run for president of the United States? Or would he have a better shot of winning the voters of the future if he went by Montgomery, his middle name. It was the late 1990s, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and a round-faced teenager in South Bend, Indiana, was viewed by many around him as an eventual successor. As early as grade school, Buttigieg exhibited an attention-grabbing combination of brains and curiosity, the sort of kid with a reputation. He would be named high school valedictorian, voted senior class president and chosen Most Likely to be U.S. President. He sat at the adults table. Now, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — not Montgomery — is indeed running for the highest office in the land. It\\'s an audacious leap. No mayor has ever gone straight to the White House (let alone from a city of just over 100,000). No president has ever been so young (he\\'ll be 39 on Inauguration Day). And no commander in chief has ever been openly gay (or had a husband). But people who have known Buttigieg since his Indiana boyhood say it all feels predictable. Interviews with nearly two dozen people who knew him in his formative years paint a picture of a child with an extraordinary range of talent and ambition, cultivated by a tight-knit family able to indulge his many interests. Friends and family say he worked to overcome an early shyness by throwing himself into challenges. All the while he felt a bit apart. \"It was always understood,\" says Patrick Bayliss, a high school friend. \"It was just kind of matter of fact that he was special and brilliant\". Now Buttigieg\\'s intellect is at the core of his campaign narrative. Admirers often cite his intelligence when asked about his appeal, arguing it makes up for a shortage of experience. But as he rises in early-caucus Iowa, Buttigieg\\'s self-confidence is exposing him to accusations that he is pretentious and entitled. When he declared Iowa was becoming a two-person race between Elizabeth Warren and him — dismissing a former vice president and several senators — Sen. Kamala Harris called him naïve. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has said the young mayor is benefiting from sexism — a woman with such a short resume wouldn\\'t be taken seriously. On Wednesday, she pointedly noted Buttigieg is a \"local official\" who lost his only statewide race. Buttigieg doesn\\'t argue much with the knocks, but doesn\\'t seem bothered either, telling reporters during his New Hampshire bus trip this month: \"I guess I\\'m comfortable doing things in a way that\\'s kind of out of order or unusual for my age and my experience\". Before he was an accomplished pianist, a polyglot, a Harvard graduate and a Rhodes scholar, Buttigieg was the only child of college professors growing up in a bubble of academia in the Rust Belt. On the campaign trail, he frequently invokes the hollowed-out city of South Bend, the onetime home of the automaker Studebaker, which shut down two decades before he was born. But Buttigieg grew up in another side of South Bend: the cluster of neighborhoods around the University of Notre Dame. His parents had stable jobs there, and he was educated in private schools whiter and wealthier than the surrounding community. His father, Joseph, was an English professor who grew up in the Mediterranean island nation of Malta. His mother was a linguist and Army brat. They met while teaching in New Mexico, married and moved to South Bend in 1980. Peter was born two years later, and they eventually settled on a tree-lined street less than two miles from the elite Catholic university. Across the river and downtown, abandoned factories, boarded-up stores and empty lots plagued South Bend. Up the hill, it was just a walk to the Golden Dome, the halo at the center of campus. Peter — the name he went by before he became known as \"Mayor Pete\" — was a curious and quiet toddler who learned to read at age 2 or 3, his mother, Anne Montgomery, said in an interview. He attended a Montessori school, where learning is self-directed and hands-on. In 6th grade, his parents moved him to a more traditional private school. The smart new kid was sometimes a target. Other kids would want to \"take him down a peg,\" his mother says. His unusual name drew snickers. The experience, she believes, helped steel him to insensitive comments. He won them over by learning to prove himself without aggravating other kids. Buttigieg remembers a teacher explaining that a child picking on him was just trying to get attention. Something clicked, he says, and he decided the best way to deal with bullies was to get to know them. The lesson still works, he told reporters on his bus. \"While you don\\'t want to reward bad behavior, you do need to make sure that people feel seen\". In his room, young Peter kept a collection of model planes and a poster of the inside of a cockpit. He aspired to become a pilot or astronaut, although his poor eyesight would make that impossible. He became fascinated with the leader closely associated with the space program, JFK. At around 11 or 12, when asked what he wanted for his birthday, Peter requested a copy of \"Profiles in Courage,\" Kennedy\\'s 1955 book on acts of political bravery by eight U.S. senators throughout history. (\"I had no idea what that was,\" says his friend Joe Geglio, who bought the book.) Later, when Buttigieg decided to join the military, he would join the Navy, like Kennedy. By the end of 8th grade, Peter was named valedictorian, which gave him a chance to deliver a speech. The adults left the gym marveling at his poise and mature demeanor. It wouldn\\'t be the last time Buttigieg found a constituency in an older generation. Classmate Loran Parker recalls her grandparents turned to her with what would become a familiar refrain: \"Peter would make a great politician\". When he arrived at high school, Buttigieg\\'s reputation preceded him. Teacher Julie Chismar recalls a buzz among French teachers. Peter began learning French in Montessori and was well on his way to fluency. He also took up Spanish and on his own started learning to read Korean from a friend. It\\'s difficult to find someone to utter a harsh word about young Peter. He wasn\\'t a jock or the most popular kid in school, but he wasn\\'t an outcast. Classmates described him as thoughtful, with a dry wit. If a kid in middle school or high school can respect a fellow kid, they respected him. He didn\\'t show off his intelligence or raise his hand to answer every question. He held back. The introvert pushed himself beyond his comfort zone. He performed in \"A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\". He learned the didgeridoo and played the several-foot-long Australian wind instrument onstage. Peter moved easily between groups of friends, but hung out mostly with a group of other smart kids. Friends said he never seemed to have the usual teenager angst about relationships. Looking back, he says now he always felt different. \"Even though I wasn\\'t out, and in many ways was not really out to myself, I felt that kind of tension,\" Buttigieg said on his campaign bus. It wasn\\'t just that he was gay, he said, but also that he was the son of a Mediterranean immigrant in an academic family who had a name that was easy to make fun of and hard to pronounce. Several people close to Buttigieg say they never knew he was gay until he came out in his 30s, after he returned from his military tour in Afghanistan. He said at a CNN town hall in October that he was well into his 20s before he acknowledged it to himself. At home, friends remember his parents as warm and supportive of whatever Peter wanted to pursue, his house inhabited by an affectionate rescue dog named Olivia, the walls lined with books, art and his mother\\'s photography, a piano filling the front room. At the dinner table, they\\'d have grown-up discussions. \"I was a kind of serious-minded kid, and they took me seriously,\" Buttigieg said. Those who have known Buttigieg from childhood say they recognize the same things during this presidential run that have driven him all his life. He says he wants to do big things, to make an impact. Asked what\\'s driving that, he becomes quiet and circumspect. \"I don\\'t know, I just do,\" he said. \"I mean, you only get one turn at life, right? And I think it\\'s really important that you do as much with it as you can\". Associated Press writer Tom Beaumont contributed to this report.LAS VEGAS (AP) — One of the most sought-after presidential endorsements in a key early voting state is from a woman who cannot vote. As Democrats jockey for support in Nevada, a meeting with Astrid Silva, a 31-year-old immigrant rights activist who has become a public face of the \"Dreamers,\" is a can\\'t-miss early stop. Silva has had dinner with Kamala Harris, policy roundtables with Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, and vegan tamales with Cory Booker. Just this week, after Pete Buttigieg noticed she attended Supreme Court arguments on the program shielding her from deportation, the candidate called to make sure she knew he supported her cause. \"Presidential wannabes, when they come here —I don\\'t know a single one that hasn\\'t met with her,\" said Harry Reid, the former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, who helped elevate Silva\\'s profile during his push for immigration reform. \"There\\'s no question in my mind that candidates are well served to visit with her\". Silva\\'s busy calendar highlights the power of Latino voters in Nevada, the third state on Democrats\\' primary calendar. The state has a large immigrant community, and Latinos account for roughly 19% of the electorate, according to the Pew Research Center. Many of those voters are Democrats, making Nevada\\'s contest a critical test of the candidates\\' appeal among a group with rising political power in the party. While immigration has taken a back seat to health care and impeachment in the national primary debate, it remains on the forefront for Nevada Democrats, many of whom want candidates to have a plan to permanently protect Dreamers and offer a path to citizenship, among a host of other changes. Silva, one of about 13,000 young immigrants in the state who are temporarily shielded from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, has become a visible figure in the push for immigration reform since meeting Reid in 2009. President Barack Obama cited her in a 2014 immigration speech, and she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. In 2016, she declared Hillary Clinton\\'s immigration plan to be the most feasible and endorsed her, helping Clinton as she won the Nevada caucuses and later carried the purple state. Her endorsement \"gives that candidate the ability to say that they have been vetted by someone who is fighting with the immigrant community for the immigrant community,\" said Democratic state Sen. Yvanna Cancela, a close friend of Silva\\'s. Silva is wary of giving that stamp of approval easily. Over the last several months, she has spent hours in private meetings in Las Vegas with the candidates, usually bringing with her a team of activists, immigrants and volunteer attorneys. Over chips and salsa at family-run Mexican restaurants or, in Booker\\'s case, vegan tamales and prayer at an altar in a local home, Silva has tried to focus the candidates on personal stories. She and others often describe the fears immigrants face and the complexities of the U.S. immigration system. They talk about sexual assault victims who are scared to report to police because they don\\'t have legal status. They recount how family members were forced to leave and remain out of the country for up to 10 years before applying to legally rejoin their family. \"It\\'s very different when you\\'re the one that\\'s afraid of the police, when you\\'re the one that\\'s afraid of ICE, when you\\'re the one that goes to bed at night thinking, \\'Will I come home tomorrow?\\'\" Silva said. Silva sometimes tells them her story, about crossing the border from Mexico at age 4 with her parents without legal possession. Until she was 26 and Nevada began issuing driver privilege cards to immigrants, she relied on the bus to get around sprawling Las Vegas. She runs a nonprofit that connects immigrants with support and legal help but says she ensures her family or friends can access her bank account to pay her bills in case her legal status changes and she ends up detained. \"Our literal everything is in somebody else\\'s hands,\" she said. \"I don\\'t have a say over my life\". While meeting with candidates, her fellow Latino immigrants often give the 2020 hopefuls small tokens to remember them, like an image of St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes, or an \"escapulario,\" a devotional necklace featuring Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, that\\'s seen as a protection from bad things. \"They can\\'t vote. The one thing they can give is their time and literally their treasures, which is their religious artifacts,\" Silva said. Booker, Warren and Harris, who had several meetings with Silva, have released Dreamer plans that would use executive action to extend protections for those already covered and allow other immigrants, like Dreamers\\' family members, to apply for protection from deportation. Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed extending protection to parents of legal residents, along with placing a moratorium on all deportations and allowing those without legal status to get health coverage under his \"Medicare for All\" plan. His campaign has been working to set up a meeting with Silva. Buttigieg and Silva spoke for about five minutes by phone on Sunday. Biden, who has not released a detailed immigration plan, has called for Congress to grant citizenship to Dreamers. But Silva remains concerned about the Democratic field. She\\'s seen few candidates truly reaching out and organizing families in the immigrant community, she said. She worries that candidates will change their tune in the general election, when the fight shifts to the Rust Belt, where immigration is an issue that could drive some white working-class voters away. \"Right now, they could be talking really nice, but when they have to go moderate, or when they have to go to the right, our families are first to be sacrificed,\" Silva said. \"We are the first to be on the cutting board because we don\\'t vote. We can\\'t vote\". Others worry about campaigns thinking one activist — or one issue — alone will unlock the Latino vote. Like other voters, Latinos care about health care, education and climate change, among other issues, said Leo Murrieta, the director of the advocacy organization Make the Road Nevada. While Silva plays an important role, candidates need to do more than meet with her \"just to check off a box,\" Murrieta said. \"One person can\\'t possibly be asked to represent an entire population,\" he said. Meanwhile, Silva acknowledges the White House race has been overshadowed by the day-to-day struggles she and other immigrants are facing, which have intensified under the Trump administration. The Supreme Court heard arguments last week about whether President Donald Trump can terminate the DACA program, and a decision is expected by the end of June. Opponents on the right argue DACA protections reward people who broke the law and encourage more people to immigrate without legal permission. Moderate Republicans have backed a path to citizenship for Dreamers, but past efforts have collapsed in Congress. \"If my work permit is taken away,\" Silva said, \"does it matter, my endorsement? Does it matter that I\\'m advocating for a candidate when I can\\'t see my family?\".

Esper told reporters at the Pentagon that Trump\\'s order was the reason he announced Sunday that Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher would be allowed to retire with his Trident Pin, retaining his status as a SEAL. Last week Trump had tweeted that he wanted Gallagher to be allowed to retire as a SEAL, but Esper\\'s comments Monday revealed that Trump had given the defense secretary a direct order to make this happen. Gallagher was acquitted of murder in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive but convicted of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017. In his remarks, Esper also made the extraordinary accusation that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer last week had secretly offered to the White House to rig the Navy disciplinary process to ensure that Gallagher not lose his Trident. He didn\\'t say how. I asked, and I never got an answer,\" Esper said. Esper fired Spencer on Sunday, saying he had lost trust in him. Spencer has not responded to requests for comment on Esper\\'s accusation. However, in a letter Sunday to Trump acknowledging his firing, Spencer gave a different version of his thinking. Spencer said he could not in good conscience follow an order that he believed would undermine the principle of good order and discipline in the military – suggesting that he had been, or expected to be, ordered to stop the peer-review process for Gallagher. Esper said he remains concerned, based on the Gallagher case and other trouble with battlefield behavior by the military, that soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are not properly and fully trained in ethical standards. He said he had ordered the Pentagon\\'s legal office to review how the military educates and trains service members on wartime ethics and the laws of armed conflict. The review also will look at how the services monitor, investigate and adjudicate adherence. In announcing Sunday that he had dismissed Spencer, Esper said he acted after learning of Spencer\\'s secret plan to guarantee the outcome of the Navy SEAL peer-review board that was scheduled to convene Dec. 2 with the goal of recommending whether Gallagher should be allowed to retain his Trident. Spencer had \"proposed a deal whereby if the president allowed the Navy to handle the case, he would guarantee that Eddie Gallagher would be restored to rank, allowed to retain his Trident and permitted to retire,\" Esper said. This was \"completely contrary\" to what Esper and the rest of the Pentagon leadership had agreed to, he said, and contrary to Spencer\\'s public position that the Navy disciplinary process should be allowed to play out with no interference. Esper said he had previously advocated for allowing the Navy peer-review board go forward Dec. 2. But when Trump gave him a \"verbal instruction\" Sunday to stop the process, he did so. \"The commander in chief has certain constitutional rights and powers which he is free to exercise, as many presidents have done in the past,\" Esper said. \"Again, these are constitutional powers\". Esper did not say explicitly that he disagreed with Trump\\'s order. Once Trump gave the order, Esper said he responded, \"Roger. I got it\". \"I can control what I can control,\" he told reporters. The president, he said, \"has every right\" to issue such an order. Esper said he had been \"flabbergasted\" when he learned at the White House on Friday that Spencer had gone behind his back to propose a secret deal. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Esper said that when he called the Navy secretary, \"he was completely forthright in admitting what had been going on\". The next day, Saturday, Esper called Trump to tell him that he intended to fire Spencer and Trump supported the decision. On Sunday afternoon Esper called Spencer and told him he was being fired. Spencer \"took it in stride\" and said he would have a resignation letter to him within 30 minutes – \"and he did\". In that letter, Spencer made no mention of what Esper called Spencer\\'s secret deal with the White House. Esper said it was best, under the extraordinary circumstances set in motion last week, that the Gallagher review board not proceed as planned. He said he believes in the military justice system, but in this case it had become untenable. \"As professional as they are,\" he said of the board members, \"no matter what they would decide, they would be criticized from many sides, which would further drag this issue on, dividing the institution. I want the SEALs and the Navy to move beyond this now, fully focused on their warfighting mission\".SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris wants to double the number of mental health treatment beds available across the country and increase access to virtual mental health counseling. Harris will roll out her mental health platform Monday at a South Carolina event with radio host Charlamagne Tha God, who has spoken about his own mental health struggles. Much of Harris\\' plan includes elements she\\'s teased on the campaign trail, where she frequently says Americans need to put just as much attention on health from the \"neck up\" as from the neck down. \"Instead of letting people silently suffer from depression, from drug addiction, from suicidal thoughts, we need to bring this out of the shadow and discuss it and put resources into it, get rid of the stigma,\" the senator from California told a crowd in Iowa this month. Harris\\' plan, released by the campaign, lists South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada, all early voting states, as priority states for increasing mental health treatment beds. It also lists Michigan, a key swing state. South Carolina, where Harris will roll out the plan, is one of the worst states for access to mental health care, according to rankings by the nonprofit organization Mental Health America. On the trail, Harris, who launched her 2020 campaign in January, has stated the need to put serious resources into mental health treatment. But her plan does not include price tags or details on what it would cost to double the number of treatment beds or cover her other proposals. It does propose a $100 million fund for Native American communities to address mental health. Spokesman Ian Sams did not respond to questions about the plan\\'s costs. Beyond doubling treatment beds, Harris proposes doubling research dollars for the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to focus on post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and other drivers of mental illness. She would direct federal agencies focused on mental health to collect better data on people facing mental illness and reclassify certain disorders, such as schizophrenia, to improve access to treatment. Harris also has proposed a loan forgiveness program for mental health workers who go to areas facing provider shortages. She introduced similar legislation last year as well as a bill to increase telemedicine. The plan goes hand in hand with Harris\\' proposed expansion of Medicare. Health care is a major flashpoint in the Democratic primary contest, and Harris has tried to strike a middle ground by proposing a \"Medicare for All\" system that preserves a role for private insurers.

(AP) — With paid speeches, a book coming out and appearances on cable news, Sarah Sanders is following the traditional route for former press secretaries after leaving the White House as President Donald Trump\\'s chief spokeswoman. But she\\'s also getting reacquainted with her home state of Arkansas and laying the groundwork for a potential governor\\'s race in three years. Sanders has begun headlining Republican Party dinners around Arkansas, allowing her to reconnect with the state she called home before joining the Trump White House and offer GOP insiders a preview of what she\\'d look like as a candidate for the job her dad, Mike Huckabee, held for more than a decade. Speaking to a ballroom packed with more than 500 people in Hot Springs last week, the former press secretary known for her televised sparring with reporters joked about being greeted by applause when she comes to the podium. \"It\\'s very different than what I\\'m used to,\" she said. Sanders and her husband, a political consultant, moved to Little Rock in late July with their three children. Since leaving the White House, she\\'s joined Fox News as a contributor and announced that she has a book coming out next year about her time as press secretary. She\\'s also delivered paid speeches and is working as a consultant for several corporations. She waived her speaking fees for local GOP speeches. Trump has encouraged her to run for governor in 2022, when Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. Sanders says she\\'s seriously looking at running for governor and is taking steps needed in case she decides to do so, but that her GOP appearances are about helping the party next year and aren\\'t about 2022. \"I think there are two types of people that run for office: people that are called and people that just want to be somebody, that want a title. I feel like in some ways, I\\'ve already hit a pretty good political title,\" Sanders told The Associated Press in an interview. \"If I do (run), it will because I feel called to do it and because I feel I can offer something to the state and I can do something to help move the state further ahead and grow it in a positive way and I fit what the state needs at that time,\" she said. Sanders\\' speeches are so far drawing sold-out crowds, with more than 600 attending an event she headlined in northwest Arkansas earlier this month. At the Hot Springs event, Sanders talked about her time in the White House, while also a mother. She told a crowd that included several people in red \"Make America Great Again\" hats about her toddler getting ahold of her phone and sending an emoji-laden tweet from her official White House account, and choked up when she talked about visiting troops overseas with the president on Christmas last year. \"Probably the biggest thing she has is 100 percent name ID and that\\'s so difficult to obtain,\" said Sen. John Boozman, whose 2010 campaign Sanders managed. \"I think almost every Arkansan knows who Sarah Huckabee Sanders is\". Sanders is looking at a race that was already drawing some of the state\\'s top GOP figures. Tim Griffin in August said he\\'s running and has appeared in TV ads paid for by a nonprofit promoting lower taxes and STEM education. Another potential candidate, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, is frequently on TV in public service announcements on vaping and other issues. Another potential candidate is state Senate President Jim Hendren, who is Hutchinson\\'s nephew. No Democrats have announced or said they\\'re taking a look at the race. Sanders remains a blank slate on many state issues that would likely come up in a heated primary. They include the state\\'s Medicaid expansion, which has sharply divided Republicans since it was approved six years ago. Sanders steered clear of state policy in her Hot Springs speech and said she wants to avoid distracting from Hutchinson\\'s agenda. \"It\\'s time to let the governor do his job and I don\\'t think it\\'s helpful for me to try to play a game from the side. That doesn\\'t help him. That doesn\\'t help the state,\" she said. Such reticence may not be enough for some Republicans if Sanders moves closer toward a gubernatorial bid. \"If she wants the role of governor, she needs to start speaking on the issues that confront our state and let us see what it is she would do and why she should be the candidate we would support,\" Republican state Rep. Les Warren said. Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo.WASHINGTON (AP) — Former national security adviser John Bolton said Friday in a series of cryptic tweets that he\\'s regained control of his personal Twitter account, asserting the White House refused to provide access to it after he resigned in September, a charge President Donald Trump rejected. Bolton and Trump clashed frequently on foreign policy and the president said the hawkish Bolton did not get along with others in the administration and was out of step with him on policy. Bolton\\'s actions and words have been closely followed ever since, particularly concerning the House impeachment inquiry. Bolton has declined to testify unless a federal judge determines he can be compelled to testify against the White House\\'s wishes. But his attorney said Bolton was aware of \"many relevant meetings and conversations\" related to the Ukraine pressure campaign. Bolton issued a series of tweets Friday that began with him saying he was glad to be back on Twitter and to \"stay tuned\". A third tweet accused the White House of refusing to return access to the account, asking, \"Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I\\'m sorry to disappoint!\". Finally, Bolton thanked Twitter for \"standing by their community standards\" and \"rightfully returning control\" of his account. Twitter declined to comment. Trump was asked on Fox News whether the White House froze Bolton\\'s Twitter account. \"Of course not. No, I actually had a good relationship with John,\" Trump said. \"We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship. No, I didn\\'t do that\".SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — It was a running joke in his AP U.S. history class at Saint Joseph High School: Would Peter Buttigieg — the smartest kid in class, language whiz and devotee of John F. Kennedy — use his unusual last name in his eventual run for president of the United States? Or would he have a better shot of winning the voters of the future if he went by Montgomery, his middle name. It was the late 1990s, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and a round-faced teenager in South Bend, Indiana, was viewed by many around him as an eventual successor. As early as grade school, Buttigieg exhibited an attention-grabbing combination of brains and curiosity, the sort of kid with a reputation — among kids and teachers. He would be named high school valedictorian, voted senior class president and chosen Most Likely to be U.S. President. He sat at the adults table. Now, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — not Montgomery — is indeed running for the highest office in the land. It\\'s an audacious leap. No mayor has ever gone straight to the White House (let alone from a city of just over 100,000). No president has ever been so young (he\\'ll be 39 on Inauguration Day). And no commander in chief has ever been openly gay (or had a husband). But people who have known Buttigieg since his Indiana boyhood say it all feels predictable. Interviews with nearly two dozen people who knew him in his formative years paint a picture of a child with an extraordinary range of talent and ambition, cultivated by a tight-knit family able to indulge his many interests. There were clear signs of the candidate\\'s earnestness and intensity. Friends and family say he worked to overcome an early shyness by throwing himself into challenges. All the while he felt a bit apart. \"It was always understood,\" says Patrick Bayliss, a friend from high school. \"It was just kind of matter of fact that he was special and brilliant\". Now Buttigieg\\'s intellect is at the core of his campaign narrative. He\\'s won headlines for his achievements and improbable hobbies. (Speaks Norwegian? Plays the didgeridoo? Admirers often cite his intelligence when asked about his appeal, arguing it makes up for a shortage of experience. But as he rises in early-caucus Iowa, Buttigieg\\'s self-confidence is exposing him to accusations that he is pretentious and entitled. When he declared Iowa was becoming a two-person race between Elizabeth Warren and him — dismissing a former vice president and several senators — Sen. Kamala Harris called him naïve. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has repeatedly argued that the young mayor is benefiting from sexism — a woman with such a short resume wouldn\\'t be taken seriously. On Wednesday, she pointedly noted Buttigieg is a \"local official\" who lost his only statewide race. \"I think experience should matter,\" she said. Buttigieg doesn\\'t argue much with the knocks, but he doesn\\'t seem bothered either, telling reporters during his New Hampshire bus trip this month: \"I guess I\\'m comfortable doing things in a way that\\'s kind of out of order or unusual for my age and my experience\". Before he was an accomplished pianist, a polyglot, a Harvard graduate and a Rhodes scholar, Buttigieg was the only child of college professors growing up in a bubble of academia in the Rust Belt. On the campaign trail, he frequently invokes the hollowed-out city of South Bend, the onetime home of the automaker Studebaker, which shut down two decades before he was born. But Buttigieg grew up in another side of South Bend: the cluster of neighborhoods around the University of Notre Dame, home to thousands of students and professors. His parents had stable jobs at the elite Catholic school, and he was educated in private schools whiter and wealthier than the surrounding community. His father, Joseph, was a professor of English, garnering attention for his scholarship in critical theory and civil society. Joseph earned degrees in his home country — the Mediterranean island nation of Malta — then from Heythrop College in Oxford, England, before moving to the United States to earn his doctorate. He met Buttigieg\\'s mother, a linguist and Army brat with roots in Indiana, when they were both on faculty at New Mexico State University. They married and moved to South Bend in 1980. Peter was born two years later. The young family eventually settled on a tree-lined street less than two miles from campus. Across the river and downtown, abandoned factories, boarded-up stores and empty lots plagued South Bend. Up the hill, it was just a walk to the Golden Dome, the halo at the center of campus. Peter — the name he went by before he became known as \"Mayor Pete\" — was a curious and quiet toddler who learned to read at the age of 2 or 3, his mother, Anne Montgomery, said in an interview. His parents sent him to a Montessori school, where learning is self-directed, hands-on and less structured than at a traditional grade school. But by 6th grade, his parents moved him to a more traditional private school. Buttigieg had figured out how to \"game the system,\" said Judith Fox, a longtime family friend, recalling the decision. \"My mind wandered a lot when I was a kid. And so, it took a nudge from them here and then just to stay on track\". Buttigieg said in an interview with AP. The smart new kid was sometimes a target. Other kids would want to \"take him down a peg,\" his mother says. His unusual name drew snickers. The experience, she believes, was a lesson in \"how cruel people can be\" and helped steel him to insensitive comments later. \"He won them over,\" his mother says, by learning to prove himself without aggravating other kids. Buttigieg remembers a teacher explaining that a child picking on him was just trying to get attention. Something clicked, he says, and he decided the best way to deal with bullies was to get to know them. The lesson still works sometimes when he comes under criticism, he says. \"While you don\\'t want to reward bad behavior, you do need to make sure that people feel seen\". In his room, young Peter kept a collection of model planes and a poster of the inside of a cockpit. He aspired to become a pilot or even an astronaut, although his poor eyesight would make that impossible. He became fascinated with the leader closely associated with the space program, JFK, and others in the Kennedy clan. At around 11 or 12, when asked what he wanted for his birthday, Peter requested a copy of \"Profiles in Courage,\" Kennedy\\'s 1955 book on acts of political bravery by eight U.S. senators throughout history. (\"I had no idea what that was,\" says his friend Joe Geglio, who bought the book for his friend.) Peter would memorize excerpts of Kennedy speeches. In high school, his close friend James Mueller remembers him reciting a favorite passage from the president\\'s 1962 \"moon\" speech: \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard\". Later, when Buttigieg decided to join the military, he would join the Navy, like JFK. Buttigieg said the Kennedy mystique loomed large in a community as Catholic as South Bend. He was aware that the presidential campaign of Sen. Robert Kennedy, and the Kennedy tragedies, were defining experiences for his parents\\' generation. Amid the culture wars of the Clinton era, he looked back nostalgically at a time when big things seemed possible. By comparison, \"we\\'ve been stuck and haven\\'t made progress on a lot of the big issues,\" Mueller said of his friend\\'s fixation with the Kennedy era. By the end of 8th grade, Peter was named valedictorian, which gave him a chance to deliver his own big speech. His performance — practiced and strikingly mature — is still remembered today by people who were there. \"It wasn\\'t like watching an 8th grader up there,\" says classmate Gavin Ferlic. The adults left the gym commenting about his poise. It wouldn\\'t be the last time Buttigieg found a constituency in an older generation. Classmate Loran Parker recalls her grandparents turned to her with what would become a familiar refrain: \"Peter would make a great politician\". Soon after, the South Bend Tribune published a profile when Buttigieg won a statewide essay contest on the importance of the law. In truth, 14-year-old Peter told the newspaper, it wasn\\'t the law, but aeronautics or journalism that really interested him. The article noted he had won numerous other awards and was set to perform in a statewide piano competition later in the year — he started playing at age 5 — and aspired to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"There are a lot of things I\\'d like to do,\" he told the Tribune. By the time he arrived at high school, Buttigieg\\'s reputation had preceded him. Julie Chismar, a teacher at Saint Joe, recalls a buzz among French teachers, who had heard about his language abilities. Peter had begun to learn French in Montessori and before he got to high school was well on his way to fluency. He also took up Spanish and on his own started learning to read Korean from a friend, Judy Kim. (His campaign does not list Korean as among the seven languages he speaks other than English.) It\\'s difficult to find someone to utter a harsh word about young Buttigieg. He wasn\\'t a jock or the most popular kid, but he wasn\\'t an outcast. Classmates described him as thoughtful, with a dry wit. If a kid in middle school or high school can respect a fellow kid, they respected him. He didn\\'t show off his intelligence or raise his hand to answer every question. He held back. Occasionally, there were signs of the reserve and stiffness that sometimes gets mocked today. When he first met Peter, Mueller, his close high school friend, would tease him good-naturedly — just like he did with his brothers. Peter, who had no siblings, did not appreciate it. \"He likes to make the joke that when he first met me, he didn\\'t like me very much\" Mueller says. The introvert pushed himself beyond his comfort zone. He joined drama his senior year and performed in \"A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\". He learned the didgeridoo and played the several-foot-long Australian wind instrument onstage. In Peter\\'s basement after school, he and his friends would watch \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" play old school Nintendo games or have Nerf battles, then go outside to play football or soccer. As they got older, his friends would play music together: He learned guitar and bass, and especially liked playing Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix songs, using his wah-wah pedal. He\\'d go to parties and even have a drink or two, Mueller said. (When he saw his friend smoke pot, during a visit home from college, Mueller ribbed him: \"Are you ever going to run for office someday?\"). Peter moved between groups of friends, but hung out mostly with a group of other smart kids. He dated a couple of girls in high school. Friends said he never seemed to have the usual teen angst about relationships. Looking back, he says now he always felt different. \"Even though I wasn\\'t out, and in many ways was not really out to myself, I felt that kind of tension,\" Buttigieg said on his campaign bus. \"It wasn\\'t only from being gay, I mean, also just being culturally a little different. Just because I was the son of a Mediterranean immigrant, an academic family, that some people thought was weird, because I had a name that was easy to make fun of and hard to pronounce\". Several people close to Buttigieg say they never knew he was gay until he came out in his 30s, after he returned from his military tour in Afghanistan. He said at a CNN town hall in October that he was well into his 20s before he acknowledged it to himself. Even his mother says she had no suspicions before he came out to her and his father in 2015, not long before he made it public in an op-ed in the local newspaper. \"I wonder if I was blind,\" his mother told the AP. \"He was a private person about personal matters, so I did not inquire or ask. Offered all kinds of opportunities. But no\". At home, friends who grew up with Buttigieg remember his parents as warm and supportive of whatever Peter wanted to pursue, his house inhabited by an affectionate rescue dog named Olivia, the walls lined with books, art and his mother\\'s photography, a piano filling the front room. He and his mom would joke together. He and his dad would obsess — and commiserate — over Notre Dame football. Politics and current events were \"in the air\" at his house, he says. His father would come home from work, pour himself a drink and open The New York Times. They\\'d watch the evening news together. Friends and colleagues from the university would come to dinner, and young Peter would join in the conversation. \"I felt like, we spoke as adults from a relatively early age,\" he says of his parents. \"I was a kind of serious-minded kid, and they took me seriously\". Still, his family wasn\\'t politically connected, and he never met any elected officials when he was a kid. \"It took me a while to just feel like it was something I could be part of,\" he told the AP. \"But it always seemed like something that was the thing that mattered most: what was going on in the world, war and peace and elections, and all of that stuff\". Later in high school, Buttigieg began to focus more sharply on politics. He joined the Philosophy Club, a way of thinking that suited him, his teacher Patrick McCurry says. \"He was already thinking about the world and systemic problems\". In the spring of 2000, his senior year, he won the Profiles in Courage essay contest, sponsored by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Foundation. His subject was then-U.S. Rep. Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, now a senator and one of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. He praised Sanders\\' political courage in calling himself a \"socialist\" and for representing Kennedy\\'s ideal of \"compromises of issues, not of principles\". He also wrote that Sanders\\' conviction and energy could bring people together in a political climate in which cynicism reigned. \"I have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service,\" Buttigieg wrote. \"I can personally assure you this is untrue\". He pursued another path traveled by JFK: Harvard. A schoolmate, Ian Seniff, remembers Buttigieg telling Mrs. Chismar his acceptance news in a hallway at Saint Joe. He compares the look on Peter\\'s face to the moment Spider-Man is anointed an Avenger in the movie \"Avengers: Infinity War\". \"There\\'s this look of, \\'This is what I\\'ve wanted. I\\'ve accomplished this,\\'\" Seniff said. \"And then an instant later, just having this solemn look of, \\'OK, now there\\'s this added level of responsibility, and it\\'s time to get ready for work.\\'\". Those who have known Buttigieg from childhood say they recognize the same things during this presidential run that have driven him all his life. He says he wants to do big things, to make an impact. Asked what\\'s driving that, he becomes quiet and circumspect. \"I don\\'t know, I just do,\" he said. \"I mean, you only get one turn at life, right? And I think it\\'s really important that you do as much with it as you can\". When pressed, he continued:. \"Where is it going to matter that it was me and not somebody else doing something? And am I making the best use of limited time? And I think I always felt that way\". At an arena in Des Moines, Iowa, this month, his supporters chanted his name and hoisted signs reading \"BOOT-EDGE-EDGE,\" the slogan he uses to help people pronounce it. He kicked off his speech by invoking the memory of another \"young man with a funny name,\" Barack Obama. In his high school history class, when his teacher or other kids would advise him to use his middle name to run for president, his friend Judy Kim recalls that Peter would listen and even welcome their advice. His last name was too difficult to pronounce. It looked strange when written out. It wasn\\'t distinguished like other American presidents. He\\'d hear them out, then stand by his position. Peter was proud of his Maltese heritage and proud of his last name. When he ran, he would tell them, it would be as Buttigieg. Associated Press writer Tom Beaumont contributed to this report.

Elizabeth Warren showed she has a plan for that. The Massachusetts senator has built a top-tier campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination largely by gathering support from progressive whites. But the contours of her new approach — and the preparation that went into it — was apparent well before Warren took the stage at Clark-Atlanta University. Prominent black women were on hand to vouch for Warren\\'s commitment to their priorities. They included Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts congresswoman and rising Democratic star, and Angela Peoples, an organizer who gained fame after she was photographed at the 2017 Women\\'s March holding a sign saying, \"Don\\'t Forget: White Women Voted for Trump\". Both have endorsed Warren for president. The 70-year-old white woman also shook up her routine. Instead of walking onstage to the usual tune from Dolly Parton\\'s \"9 to 5,\" Warren\\'s campaign blared \"Respect\" by Aretha Franklin, the queen of soul. The senator then delivered a soaring speech that connected parable to policy and, in the process, made one of the strongest appeals to black voters of any Democratic White House hopeful during the 2020 primary. It was no accident that she delivered her remarks in Atlanta, considered the capital of black America. Her speech focused on the story of the city\\'s black washerwomen\\'s strike of 1881, when thousands of women — including some less than a generation out of slavery —walked off the job seeking higher wages and more dignity. They were later joined by white washerwomen who saw a shared struggle, and their protest became an example for other African Americans working in domestic and service roles. That little-known history formed the building blocks for the case Warren is now pitching to Democratic voters — including white Americans wondering how a push to right historic wrongs could threaten their quality of life. \"To this day, racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame \\'them\\' — people who don\\'t look like you,\" she warned. \"The wealthy and well-connected want us to believe that more for your neighbors will always mean less for you. But the truth is, when we come together, we can all move forward\". The evening\\'s celebratory atmosphere was its own testimony to the rising power and influence of black female voters. It underscored the role that black women are playing in Warren\\'s campaign: in the audience, among her staff, even the female DJ spinning a playlist featuring Beyoncé, Aaliyah, Lauryn Hill. Warren\\'s remarks were the culmination of months of conversations with black female activists and a testament to her growth as a white progressive woman. In closed-door discussions, Warren listened as those activists laid out their agenda for the next president of the United States: reparations for slavery, environmental and reproductive justice, ending cash bail, addressing systemic and institutional racism. On Thursday, their priorities became hers. \"America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people,\" Warren declared in a remark hardly imaginable in a pre-Barack Obama presidential cycle. \"The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it\". Among the deepest fault lines in Democratic politics exposed since 2016 is the rift between the black women who voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton and the white women who did not, voting either for Donald Trump or staying home. Headed into 2020, many black women wonder whether white women will make a different choice — a dynamic that has, in part, fueled skepticism toward Warren\\'s candidacy. She positioned herself in Atlanta as an ally not just asking for black votes, but also vowing to govern in part according to their concerns. This week\\'s debate featured a conversation among candidates about who is best positioned to build a broad coalition and unify the country after the election. Warren presented a new argument: that the key to the Democratic nomination and to victory in November is not a unifying candidate but a unified electorate. The speech came at a crossroads in the 2020 campaign, on the day after yet another debate that left many voters still trying to discern who is best positioned to beat Trump next fall. So far, the distinction has gone to former Vice President Joe Biden, with Democrats — and black voters, in particular — putting their faith in him to avert their worst fears. Using the examples of fearless black women who fought to perfect American democracy, Warren told the crowd Thursday that fear will not be the way forward in 2020. \"Yes, there\\'s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared,\" she said, her voice reaching a crescendo over the roaring crowd. \"But the washerwomen were not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can\\'t be afraid, either\". With the most diverse field of candidates ever running in the 2020 Democratic primary, the potential to make history abounds — including for Warren, who could become the country\\'s first female president. But as voters, especially African Americans, process the campaign, there is more at stake for them than making history. For black voters, the pragmatic calculation in considering the nominee comes down to two main questions: Do you speak to me? And can you win. So far, there\\'s no empirical evidence that Warren has answered those questions for them. But if she does, it could well be because she told the story of a group of bold, black women, to a gymnasium full of black women, on a Thursday night in November. EDITOR\\'S NOTE — Errin Haines has covered race and politics for the AP since 2015.JERUSALEM (AP) — He was accused of using his high office to advance his personal political interests. He derided the investigation as a \"witch hunt\" fueled by \"fake news\" — an \"attempted coup\". He counted on his right-wing base, his hand-picked attorney general and his media savvy to weather the crisis. Not U.S. President Donald Trump, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was indicted Thursday on corruption charges. Netanyahu\\'s indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust marks the culmination of three long-running corruption cases. In the most serious, he is accused of accepting bribes from a telecom magnate by promoting regulations worth hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange for favorable media coverage on a popular news site owned by the company. The announcement of the charges coincided with the final day of public impeachment hearings by the U.S. House of Representatives, in which officials provided a mountain of evidence to support allegations that Trump used the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump and his supporters have furiously denied any wrongdoing, alleging a deep state conspiracy fanned by a hostile media aimed at reversing the 2016 election. Netanyahu has adopted similar tactics and even the same language, alleging a conspiracy by police and prosecutors to end the 10-year rule of Israel\\'s longest-serving prime minister. He has held large Trump-like rallies in recent months and has repeatedly taken to the airwaves and social media, banking on his legendary political skills as the walls closed in. \"Police and investigators are not above the law,\" Netanyahu said in an angry televised statement late Thursday, in which he said the country was witnessing an \"attempted coup\". \"The time has come to investigate the investigators,\" he declared, adopting an oft-used Trump line. On Thursday, Trump called the Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry \"human scum\" in a tweet, saying it was the \"most unfair hearings in American history\". Beyond their shared political style, the two leaders have forged a tight alliance. Trump has sided with Israel on key issues related to the conflict with the Palestinians, and Netanyahu has boasted of his close ties to the American president, saying they have brought about unprecedented gains for Israel. The strategy of rallying their base while lashing out at institutions that sought to curb their power seemed to be working for both men — as it has for other right-wing populists — until elections saw their fortunes change. Last year\\'s midterm elections in the United States gave Democrats control of the House and a platform to investigate the administration. It now seems almost certain that Trump will be impeached on a party-line vote, though there is no indication the Republican-led Senate will remove him from office. Sitting U.S. presidents cannot be indicted. The beginning of the end for Netanyahu may have come in September\\'s elections, when he and his right-wing allies failed to win enough seats to form a majority coalition. Efforts to form a unity government have failed, in part because of Netanyahu\\'s legal woes, and the country now appears to be heading toward an unprecedented third election in less than a year. \"We\\'ve seen populist right-wing governments around the world attack the judiciary, attack the media,\" and some have been successful, Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli columnist and the author of a biography of Netanyahu, told The Associated Press. \"But I think that in Israel and in the U.S., we\\'ve seen all these pillars of the democratic system fighting back and proving their resilience in the face of this kind of populist leader\". Netanyahu is not legally required to resign but faces heavy pressure to do so, and the indictment could weigh down his Likud party ahead of new elections. Like Trump, he enjoys near absolute loyalty within his own party, but that too could change. Hours before the indictment was announced, a senior Likud member suggested there should be a party primary ahead of third elections and that he would be a candidate. No such challenge has materialized in Trump\\'s Republican Party, but it\\'s still a year before the presidential election. As Netanyahu has found in recent weeks, things can change quickly. \"Something was different yesterday,\" Sima Kadmon, a columnist for the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, wrote about Netanyahu\\'s defiant speech. \"It simply didn\\'t work, perhaps because there is nothing alluring about a wounded animal except the smell of its blood\". \"The Netanyahu era has never looked closer to its end than in those moments when he was fighting for it to continue,\" she wrote. Netanyahu had apparently counted on his hand-picked attorney general to shield him from prosecution. But despite coming under heavy pressure from Netanyahu supporters, who at times held demonstrations outside his home, Avichai Mandelblit personally announced the indictment on all charges Thursday, saying it was \"not a matter of politics\". Despite their setbacks, both Netanyahu and Trump are digging in for a long struggle with their equally determined opponents. \"The indictment in Israel and the expected one in the United States would only contribute to the high level of polarization and mistrust and conflict and confrontation between the two major camps,\" said Eytan Gilboa, a professor of political science at Israel\\'s Bar-Ilan University. \"The results could be similar in the sense of increasing the level of confrontation,\" he said. Follow Joseph Krauss on Twitter at www.twitter.com/josephkrauss.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and the House impeachment inquiry (all times local):. President Donald Trump says he does not expect to be impeached, claiming Democrats have \"absolutely nothing\" incriminating, despite days of public testimony by witnesses who said Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to press the country to investigate his political rivals. Trump told \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday, \"I think it\\'s very hard to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing\". Trump said if the House did vote to impeach him, he would welcome a trial in the Senate. Witnesses including State Department officials, current and former U.S. ambassadors and a former White House Russia analyst provided evidence in the House impeachment public hearings. Testimony indicated Trump explicitly ordered U.S. government officials to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani (joo-lee-AH\\'-nee) on matters related to Ukraine, a country deeply dependent on Washington\\'s help to fend off Russian aggression. But Trump says he was only holding back aid to root out corruption in Ukraine. President Donald Trump is still promoting a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, a day after a former White House security adviser called it a \"fictional narrative\". Trump called in to \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday and said he was trying to root out corruption in the Eastern European nation when he withheld aid over the summer. Trump\\'s July 25 call with Ukraine\\'s president is at the center of the House impeachment probe, which is looking into Trump\\'s pressure on Ukraine to investigate political rivals as he held back nearly $400 million. Trump said, \"There was no quid pro quo,\" contradicting testimony by impeachment witnesses. On Thursday, a former White House Russia analyst said the debunked theory that Ukraine was behind election interference played into Russia\\'s hands.SOUTH BEND, Ind.

Buttigieg had figured out how to \"game the system,\" said Judith Fox, a longtime family friend, recalling the decision. \"My mind wandered a lot when I was a kid. And so, it took a nudge from them here and then just to stay on track\". Buttigieg said in an interview with AP. The smart new kid was sometimes a target. Other kids would want to \"take him down a peg,\" his mother says. His unusual name drew snickers. The experience, she believes, was a lesson in \"how cruel people can be\" and helped steel him to insensitive comments later. \"He won them over,\" his mother says, by learning to prove himself without aggravating other kids. Buttigieg remembers a teacher explaining that a child picking on him was just trying to get attention. Something clicked, he says, and he decided the best way to deal with bullies was to get to know them. The lesson still works sometimes when he comes under criticism, he says. \"While you don\\'t want to reward bad behavior, you do need to make sure that people feel seen\". In his room, young Peter kept a collection of model planes and a poster of the inside of a cockpit. He aspired to become a pilot or even an astronaut, although his poor eyesight would make that impossible. He became fascinated with the leader closely associated with the space program, JFK, and others in the Kennedy clan. At around 11 or 12, when asked what he wanted for his birthday, Peter requested a copy of \"Profiles in Courage,\" Kennedy\\'s 1955 book on acts of political bravery by eight U.S. senators throughout history. (\"I had no idea what that was,\" says his friend Joe Geglio, who bought the book for his friend.) Peter would memorize excerpts of Kennedy speeches. In high school, his close friend James Mueller remembers him reciting a favorite passage from the president\\'s 1962 \"moon\" speech: \"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard\". Later, when Buttigieg decided to join the military, he would join the Navy, like JFK. Buttigieg said the Kennedy mystique loomed large in a community as Catholic as South Bend. He was aware that the presidential campaign of Sen. Robert Kennedy, and the Kennedy tragedies, were defining experiences for his parents\\' generation. Amid the culture wars of the Clinton era, he looked back nostalgically at a time when big things seemed possible. By comparison, \"we\\'ve been stuck and haven\\'t made progress on a lot of the big issues,\" Mueller said of his friend\\'s fixation with the Kennedy era. By the end of 8th grade, Peter was named valedictorian, which gave him a chance to deliver his own big speech. His performance — practiced and strikingly mature — is still remembered today by people who were there. \"It wasn\\'t like watching an 8th grader up there,\" says classmate Gavin Ferlic. The adults left the gym commenting about his poise. It wouldn\\'t be the last time Buttigieg found a constituency in an older generation. Classmate Loran Parker recalls her grandparents turned to her with what would become a familiar refrain: \"Peter would make a great politician\". Soon after, the South Bend Tribune published a profile when Buttigieg won a statewide essay contest on the importance of the law. In truth, 14-year-old Peter told the newspaper, it wasn\\'t the law, but aeronautics or journalism that really interested him. The article noted he had won numerous other awards and was set to perform in a statewide piano competition later in the year — he started playing at age 5 — and aspired to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"There are a lot of things I\\'d like to do,\" he told the Tribune. By the time he arrived at high school, Buttigieg\\'s reputation had preceded him. Julie Chismar, a teacher at Saint Joe, recalls a buzz among French teachers, who had heard about his language abilities. Peter had begun to learn French in Montessori and before he got to high school was well on his way to fluency. He also took up Spanish and on his own started learning to read Korean from a friend, Judy Kim. (His campaign does not list Korean as among the seven languages he speaks other than English.) It\\'s difficult to find someone to utter a harsh word about young Buttigieg. He wasn\\'t a jock or the most popular kid, but he wasn\\'t an outcast. Classmates described him as thoughtful, with a dry wit. If a kid in middle school or high school can respect a fellow kid, they respected him. He didn\\'t show off his intelligence or raise his hand to answer every question. He held back. Occasionally, there were signs of the reserve and stiffness that sometimes gets mocked today. When he first met Peter, Mueller, his close high school friend, would tease him good-naturedly — just like he did with his brothers. Peter, who had no siblings, did not appreciate it. \"He likes to make the joke that when he first met me, he didn\\'t like me very much\" Mueller says. The introvert pushed himself beyond his comfort zone. He joined drama his senior year and performed in \"A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\". He learned the didgeridoo and played the several-foot-long Australian wind instrument onstage. In Peter\\'s basement after school, he and his friends would watch \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" play old school Nintendo games or have Nerf battles, then go outside to play football or soccer. As they got older, his friends would play music together: He learned guitar and bass, and especially liked playing Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix songs, using his wah-wah pedal. He\\'d go to parties and even have a drink or two, Mueller said. (When he saw his friend smoke pot, during a visit home from college, Mueller ribbed him: \"Are you ever going to run for office someday?\"). Peter moved between groups of friends, but hung out mostly with a group of other smart kids. He dated a couple of girls in high school. Friends said he never seemed to have the usual teen angst about relationships. Looking back, he says now he always felt different. \"Even though I wasn\\'t out, and in many ways was not really out to myself, I felt that kind of tension,\" Buttigieg said on his campaign bus. \"It wasn\\'t only from being gay, I mean, also just being culturally a little different. Just because I was the son of a Mediterranean immigrant, an academic family, that some people thought was weird, because I had a name that was easy to make fun of and hard to pronounce\". Several people close to Buttigieg say they never knew he was gay until he came out in his 30s, after he returned from his military tour in Afghanistan. He said at a CNN town hall in October that he was well into his 20s before he acknowledged it to himself. Even his mother says she had no suspicions before he came out to her and his father in 2015, not long before he made it public in an op-ed in the local newspaper. \"I wonder if I was blind,\" his mother told the AP. \"He was a private person about personal matters, so I did not inquire or ask. Offered all kinds of opportunities. But no\". At home, friends who grew up with Buttigieg remember his parents as warm and supportive of whatever Peter wanted to pursue, his house inhabited by an affectionate rescue dog named Olivia, the walls lined with books, art and his mother\\'s photography, a piano filling the front room. He and his mom would joke together. He and his dad would obsess — and commiserate — over Notre Dame football. Politics and current events were \"in the air\" at his house, he says. His father would come home from work, pour himself a drink and open The New York Times. They\\'d watch the evening news together. Friends and colleagues from the university would come to dinner, and young Peter would join in the conversation. \"I felt like, we spoke as adults from a relatively early age,\" he says of his parents. \"I was a kind of serious-minded kid, and they took me seriously\". Still, his family wasn\\'t politically connected, and he never met any elected officials when he was a kid. \"It took me a while to just feel like it was something I could be part of,\" he told the AP. \"But it always seemed like something that was the thing that mattered most: what was going on in the world, war and peace and elections, and all of that stuff\". Later in high school, Buttigieg began to focus more sharply on politics. He joined the Philosophy Club, a way of thinking that suited him, his teacher Patrick McCurry says. \"He was already thinking about the world and systemic problems\". In the spring of 2000, his senior year, he won the Profiles in Courage essay contest, sponsored by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Foundation. His subject was then-U.S. Rep. Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, now a senator and one of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. He praised Sanders\\' political courage in calling himself a \"socialist\" and for representing Kennedy\\'s ideal of \"compromises of issues, not of principles\". He also wrote that Sanders\\' conviction and energy could bring people together in a political climate in which cynicism reigned. \"I have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service,\" Buttigieg wrote. \"I can personally assure you this is untrue\". He pursued another path traveled by JFK: Harvard. A schoolmate, Ian Seniff, remembers Buttigieg telling Mrs. Chismar his acceptance news in a hallway at Saint Joe. He compares the look on Peter\\'s face to the moment Spider-Man is anointed an Avenger in the movie \"Avengers: Infinity War\". \"There\\'s this look of, \\'This is what I\\'ve wanted. I\\'ve accomplished this,\\'\" Seniff said. \"And then an instant later, just having this solemn look of, \\'OK, now there\\'s this added level of responsibility, and it\\'s time to get ready for work.\\'\". Those who have known Buttigieg from childhood say they recognize the same things during this presidential run that have driven him all his life. He says he wants to do big things, to make an impact. Asked what\\'s driving that, he becomes quiet and circumspect. \"I don\\'t know, I just do,\" he said. \"I mean, you only get one turn at life, right? And I think it\\'s really important that you do as much with it as you can\". When pressed, he continued:. \"Where is it going to matter that it was me and not somebody else doing something? And am I making the best use of limited time? And I think I always felt that way\". At an arena in Des Moines, Iowa, this month, his supporters chanted his name and hoisted signs reading \"BOOT-EDGE-EDGE,\" the slogan he uses to help people pronounce it. He kicked off his speech by invoking the memory of another \"young man with a funny name,\" Barack Obama. In his high school history class, when his teacher or other kids would advise him to use his middle name to run for president, his friend Judy Kim recalls that Peter would listen and even welcome their advice. His last name was too difficult to pronounce. It looked strange when written out. It wasn\\'t distinguished like other American presidents. He\\'d hear them out, then stand by his position. Peter was proud of his Maltese heritage and proud of his last name. When he ran, he would tell them, it would be as Buttigieg.

Top lawmakers of the House and Senate Appropriations committees on Saturday confirmed agreement on allocations for each of the 12 spending bills, a step that allows negotiations on the $1.4 trillion budget bundle to begin in earnest to try to pass the measures by a Dec. 20 deadline. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., announced the agreement on Saturday through aides. The measures would fill in the details on this summer\\'s hard-won budget and debt deal. The pact is sought by a broad spectrum of GOP defense hawks, Democrats pressing to maintain recent gains in domestic programs, and a dwindling cadre of Washington pragmatists eager to demonstrate that they can make divided government work in an increasingly toxic atmosphere. The talks come as the Democratic-controlled House is driving toward impeaching President Donald Trump, whose demands for billions of dollars more for additional wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border have slowed the process. Trump has little interest in the often-arcane appropriations process, other than to obtain wall funding and to boast about record Pentagon funding. The annual spending bills are, however, a top priority for top lawmakers like Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who have wrestled over appropriations for decades. Trump has been limited in success in winning wall funding from Congress, where there is relatively little enthusiasm for the project among his GOP allies and strong opposition from most Democrats. Congress provided just $1.4 billion in wall funding last year. But Trump has won considerably more money through transfers from Pentagon accounts by exploiting budget rules. He is seeking $8.6 billion, including $5 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, but would win far less under the tentative accord. Lawmakers passed a stopgap measure this week to fund the government through Dec. 20. Saturday\\'s pact opens the door to a final agreement by that date, though the spending bundling is probably more likely to spill over into next year.WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump has kicked off the holiday season in the nation\\'s capital by accepting delivery of the official White House Christmas tree. A horse-drawn carriage delivered the tree to the front door of the White House on Monday as members of a military band played Christmas music. The first lady walked around the carriage and inspected the tree, which will become the centerpiece of Christmas in the White House Blue Room. The tree came from Mahantongo Valley Farms in Pitman, Pennsylvania. Owner Larry Snyder earned the honor of presenting the White House a tree from his farm after winning an annual contest held by the National Christmas Tree Association. White House officials chose the tree weeks ago during a visit to Snyder\\'s farm.WASHINGTON (AP) — Newly released documents show Donald Trump\\'s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was in contact with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the months before the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was abruptly recalled. The State Department released the documents Friday to the group American Oversight in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. They show that Pompeo talked with Giuliani on March 26 and March 29. Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the documents reveal \"a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to Secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani\\'s smear campaign against a U.S. ambassador\". Last week, former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators she felt \"kneecapped\" by a \"smear campaign\" Giuliani led against her. She was withdrawn from her post in Ukraine in May. The documents released Friday also include a report, that appears with Trump hotel stationery, that appears to summarize a Jan. 23 interview with a former Ukrainian prosecutor general, Victor Shokin. The summary says Giuliani and two business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were present. Parnas and Fruman were arrested last month on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records. The men had key roles in Giuliani\\'s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter. A second memo appears to be a summary of an interview with Yuri Lutsenko, another former prosecutor general of Ukraine, conducted in the presence of Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman. Lutsenko is quoted raising questions about compensation that Hunter Biden received from the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. In a Fox News interview, Giuliani was asked Saturday about the work that Parnas and Fruman did for him in Ukraine. The two men\\'s efforts included helping to arrange a January meeting in New York between Giuliani and Lutsenko, as well as other meetings with top government officials. Lutsenko, who replaced Shokhin in 2016, left the post in August of 2019. \"So, they helped me find people, and as I\\'ve said, they did a good job, but they weren\\'t investigators, and they weren\\'t James Bond, and they didn\\'t have personal communications with the president,\" Giuliani said. Giuliani allowed that he did introduce the two men to Trump at a Hanukkah party in December of 2018. But there was no extended meeting or conversations, he said. \"They took a one-minute picture. They walked away,\" he said. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating the business dealings of Giuliani, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the probe. Giuliani was asked whether he was concerned about being indicted. \"Do you think I\\'m afraid. Do you think I get afraid? I did the right thing. I represented my client in a very, very effective way. I was so effective that I discovered a pattern of corruption that the Washington press has been covering up for three or four years,\" Giuliani asserted. Giuliani said he continues to have a good relationship with the president and that it can be assumed he talks to Trump \"early and often\". Giuliani said he\\'s seen things written that Trump is intending to throw him under the bus. \"When they say that, I say he isn\\'t, but I have insurance,\" Giuliani said.WASHINGTON (AP) — An FBI lawyer is suspected of altering a document related to surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, a person familiar with the situation said Friday. President Donald Trump, who has long attacked as a \"hoax\" and a \"witch hunt\" the FBI\\'s investigation into ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign, immediately touted news reports about the accusation to allege that the FBI had tried to \"overthrow the presidency\". The allegation is part of a Justice Department inspector general review of the FBI\\'s Russia investigation, one of the most politically sensitive probes in the bureau\\'s history. That election interference probe was ultimately taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller and resulted in charges against six Trump associates and more than two dozen Russians accused of interfering in the election. Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to release his report on Dec. 9. Witnesses in the last two weeks have been invited in to see draft sections of that document. The inspector general report — centered in part on the use of a secret surveillance warrant to monitor the communications of a former Trump adviser — is likely to revive debate about an investigation that has shadowed Trump\\'s presidency since the beginning. It will be released amid a House impeachment inquiry into Trump\\'s efforts to press Ukraine\\'s leader to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden at the same time as military aid was being withheld from the country. Trump and his supporters are likely to seize on any findings of mistakes or bad judgment in the report to support their claims of a biased investigation. Supporters of the FBI, meanwhile, are likely to hold up as vindication any findings that the investigation was done by the book or free of political considerations. The allegation against the lawyer was first reported by CNN. The Washington Post subsequently reported that the conduct of the FBI employee didn\\'t alter Horowitz\\'s finding that the surveillance application of Page had a proper legal and factual basis, an official told the Post, which said the lawyer was forced out. \"This was spying on my campaign — something that has never been done in the history of our country,\" Trump told \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday. \"They tried to overthrow the presidency\". A person familiar with the case who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke to AP only on the condition of anonymity confirmed the allegation. Spokespeople for the FBI and the inspector general declined to comment Friday. The New York Times and the Post have reported that the investigation is expected to find mistakes by lower-level officials within the FBI but will not accuse senior leaders of being motivated by political bias. The FBI obtained a secret surveillance warrant in 2016 to monitor the communications of Page, who was never charged in the Russia investigation or accused of wrongdoing. The warrant, which was renewed several times and approved by different judges in 2016 and early 2017, has been one of the most contentious elements of the Russia probe and was the subject of dueling memos last year issued by Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans have long attacked the credibility of the warrant application since it cited information derived from a dossier of opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy whose work was financed by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign. \"They got my warrant — a fraudulent warrant, I believe — to spy on myself as a way of getting into the Trump campaign,\" Page said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox\\'s \"Mornings with Maria\". \"There has been a continued cover-up to this day. We still don\\'t have the truth, but hopefully, we\\'ll get that soon\". FBI Director Chris Wray has told Congress that he did not consider the FBI surveillance to be \"spying\" and that he has no evidence the FBI illegally monitored Trump\\'s campaign during the 2016 election. Wray said he would not describe the FBI\\'s surveillance as \"spying\" if it\\'s following \"investigative policies and procedures\". Attorney General William Barr has said he believed \"spying\" did occur, but he also made clear at a Senate hearing earlier this year that he had no specific evidence that any surveillance was illegal or improper. Barr has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate how intelligence was collected, and that probe has since become criminal in nature, a person familiar with the matter has said. But Trump insists that members of the Obama administration \"at the highest levels\" were spying on his 2016 campaign. \"Personally, I think it goes all the way. I think this goes to the highest level,\" he said in the Fox interview. \"I hate to say it. I think it\\'s a disgrace. They thought I was going to win and they said, \\'How can we stop him?\\'\". Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP.NEW YORK (AP) — Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the world\\'s richest men, has formally launched a Democratic bid for president. Ending weeks of speculation, the 77-year-old former Republican announced his candidacy Sunday in a written statement posted on a campaign website describing himself as uniquely positioned to defeat President Donald Trump. He will quickly follow with a massive advertising campaign blanketing airways in key primary states across the U.S. \"I\\'m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"We cannot afford four more years of President Trump\\'s reckless and unethical actions,\" he continued. \"He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage\". Bloomberg\\'s entrance comes just 10 weeks before primary voting begins, an unorthodox move that reflects anxiety within the Democratic Party about the strength of its current candidates. As a centrist with deep ties to Wall Street, Bloomberg is expected to struggle among the party\\'s energized progressive base. He became a Democrat only last year. Yet his tremendous resources and moderate profile could be appealing in a primary contest that has become, above all, a quest to find the person best-positioned to deny Trump a second term next November. Forbes ranked Bloomberg as the 11th-richest person in the world last year with a net worth of roughly $50 billion. Trump, by contrast, was ranked 259th with a net worth of just over $3 billion. His businesses — among them are financial data services and news services in various formats — employ more than 19,000 people in 69 countries. They are also certain to raise ethical questions about how his news-oriented businesses will cover the campaign and financial conflicts of interest for a possible presidency. Already, Bloomberg has vowed to spend at least $150 million of his fortune on various pieces of a 2020 campaign, including more than $100 million for internet ads attacking Trump, between $15 million and $20 million on a voter registration drive largely targeting minority voters, and more than $30 million on an initial round of television ads. He did not say how much he would be willing to spend overall on his presidential ambitions, but senior adviser Howard Wolfson did: \"Whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump\". Wolfson also said that Bloomberg would not accept a single political donation for his campaign or take a salary should he become president. Even before the announcement was final, Democratic rivals like Bernie Sanders pounced on Bloomberg\\'s plans to rely on his personal fortune. \"We do not believe that billionaires have the right to buy elections,\" Sanders said as he campaigned in New Hampshire on Sunday. He continued: \"That is why multibillionaires like Mr. Bloomberg are not going to get very far in this election\". Elizabeth Warren, another leading progressive candidate, also slammed Bloomberg on Saturday for trying to buy the presidency. \"I understand that rich people are going to have more shoes than the rest of us, they\\'re going to have more cars than the rest of us, they\\'re going to have more houses,\" she said after a campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. \"But they don\\'t get a bigger share of democracy, especially in a Democratic primary. We need to be doing the face-to-face work that lifts every voice\". Bloomberg does not speak in his announcement video, which casts him as a successful businessman who came from humble roots and ultimately \"put his money where his heart is\" to effect change on the top policy issues of the day — gun violence, climate change, immigration and equality, among them. Bloomberg has devoted tens of millions of dollars to pursue his policy priorities in recent years, producing measurable progress in cities and states across America. He has helped shutter 282 coal plants in the United States and organized a coalition of American cities on track to cut 75 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2025. But he is far from a left-wing ideologue. Bloomberg has declined to embrace Medicare for All as a health care prescription or the \"Green New Deal\" to combat climate change, favoring a more pragmatic approach. Still, he has endeared himself to many of the nation\\'s mayors, having made huge investments to help train local officials and encouraging them to take action on climate, guns and immigration in particular. Ahead of Bloomberg\\'s presidential announcement, the mayors of Columbia, South Carolina, and Louisville, Kentucky, endorsed him. Despite that show of support from at least one prominent black leader, Bloomberg may have trouble building a multi-racial coalition early on given his turbulent record on race relations in New York. He angered many minority voters during his 12 years in the New York City mayor\\'s office for embracing and defending the controversial \"stop-and-frisk\" police strategy, despite its disproportionate impact on people of color. Facing an African-American congregation this month in Brooklyn, Bloomberg apologized and acknowledged it often led to the detention of blacks and Latinos. The apology was received skeptically by many prominent activists who noted that it was made as he was taking steps to enter the race. The campaign will be headquartered in Manhattan and managed by longtime adviser Kevin Sheekey. Wolfson will also play a senior role. Bloomberg\\'s team did not establish a super PAC before launching the campaign, preferring to run the primary campaign and a simultaneous set of general election-focused moves like the anti-Trump internet ads and voter registration drive out of the same office. The path ahead may be decidedly uphill and unfamiliar. Bloomberg plans to bypass the first four states on the primary calendar — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — and focus instead on the crush of states that vote on Super Tuesday and beyond. It\\'s a strategy that acknowledges the limitations of entering the race at this late stage and the opportunities afforded by his vast personal wealth. His team has noted that several candidates have devoted much of the year to building support on the ground in the earliest states, and Bloomberg needs to be realistic about where he can make up ground. Nearly a quarter of primary delegates are up for grabs in the March 3 Super Tuesday contests, which have gotten far less attention so far. Bloomberg has openly considered a presidential bid before, but as an independent. He declined to enter the 2016 contest only after deciding there was no path to victory without the backing of a major political party. He explored a run earlier this year, too, but decided there was no path with establishment-favorite Joe Biden in the race. Biden\\'s perceived weakness, along with the rise of progressive firebrand Warren, convinced him to reconsider. \"We believe that voters are increasingly concerned that the field is not well positioned to defeat Donald Trump,\" Wolfson said of Bloomberg\\'s decision to change his mind. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway actually praised Bloomberg\\'s tenure as mayor when asked about his announcement Sunday on CBS\\' \"Face the Nation\". But she said his entrance into the 2020 race \"means the Democratic field is underwhelming\". Should Bloomberg ultimately become the nominee to take on Trump, she said, \"We\\'re ready\". Conway cast doubt on whether he\\'d be welcomed by Democratic voters. Initially registered as a Democrat, Bloomberg, a Massachusetts native, filed paperwork to change his voter registration to Republican in 2000 before his first run for New York City mayor, according to a spokesman. In June 2007, he unenrolled from the GOP, having no formal party affiliation until he registered again as a Democrat this October. While some will question his newfound commitment to Democrats, he vowed allegiance to the party in an Associated Press interview earlier in the year, saying, \"I will be a Democrat for the rest of my life\". Associated Press writer Hunter Woodall in Manchester, New Hampshire, contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court says Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been released from a Baltimore hospital where she had been treated for a possible infection. The 86-year-old Ginsburg has returned to her home in Washington, D.C., and is \"doing well,\" court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Sunday. Ginsburg spent two nights at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was taken there Friday after experiencing chills and fever. The court says she received intravenous antibiotics and fluids and that her symptoms abated. Ginsburg has had four occurrences of cancer, including two in the past year. She had lung cancer surgery in December and received radiation treatment for a tumor on her pancreas in August. She had a rare absence from a public session of the court in mid-November because of what the court said was a stomach bug. She was back on the bench the next time the justices met. Her latest hospital stay began Friday, after the justices met in private to discuss pending cases. She was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins for further evaluation and treatment of any possible infection. Ginsburg has been on the court since 1993, appointed by President Bill Clinton. Only Justice Clarence Thomas has served longer among the current members of the court.JOHANNESBURG (AP) — The United States has called its ambassador to South Sudan back to Washington for consultations as Washington reevaluates its relationship with the country after a delay in implementing a fragile peace deal. The unusual public statement Monday by the State Department was echoed in a tweet by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as the U.S. signaled its frustration with the failure of South Sudan\\'s rivals to meet this month\\'s deadline to form a coalition government. South Sudan President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar agreed to postpone that key step for 100 days until mid-February. They had faced a Nov. 12 deadline but said security and governance issues needed to be resolved. The U.S., the top humanitarian donor to South Sudan, said the delay \"calls into question their suitability to continue to lead the nation\\'s peace process\". Its reevaluation of the relationship with South Sudan could mean further sanctions. South Sudan\\'s government has said it wanted to form the coalition government on time and blamed the opposition for the delay. Machar had asked for an extension and warned that the ceasefire would \"erupt\" without one. The peace deal was signed in September 2018 after five years of civil war killed nearly 400,000 people. The conflict began in late 2013, just two years after the country\\'s independence from Sudan, when supporters of Kiir and Machar, then his deputy, clashed. A previous peace deal under which Machar returned as Kiir\\'s deputy fell apart amid fresh fighting in 2016 and Machar fled the country on foot. Under the current agreement Machar would again become Kiir\\'s deputy. The Vatican earlier this month said Pope Francis and Anglican leader Justin Welby intend to visit South Sudan together if a coalition government can be formed in the next three months.

(AP) — A Chinese businesswoman could be headed to prison for trespassing at President Donald Trump\\'s Mar-a-Lago resort and lying to federal agents. Prosecutors want Judge Roy Altman to give Yujing Zhang 18 months in prison when he sentences her Monday afternoon. The 33-year-old Shanghai consultant was convicted in September of trespassing at the Florida resort in March and lying to Secret Service agents who confronted her. When Zhang was arrested, she was carrying four cellphones, a computer and an external hard drive, leading to speculation she could be a spy. She was never charged with espionage, though, and text messages presented at trial suggest she is obsessed with Trump. The president was at a golf course when Zhang arrived at Mar-a-Lago.ABBEVILLE, S.C. (AP) — Joe Biden has made his presidential bid official in South Carolina. The former vice president filed his paperwork as a candidate in next year\\'s Democratic primary during a stop Friday at a soul food restaurant in Abbeville. Surrounded by a crush of media and lunchtime patrons at Food for the Soul, a tiny restaurant boasting a menu of fried chicken, pork chops and burgers, Biden signed his candidacy papers at a booth with state Democratic Party Chairman Trav Robertson. \"You\\'re officially on the ballot!\" Robertson told Biden, above a din of applause from supporters. \"I\\'m going to need your help,\" Biden said to the crowd. Polls have generally shown Biden leading his rivals in South Carolina, where he maintains high popularity among the heavily black Democratic electorate. On Thursday night, he held a town hall event in Greenwood with a crowd of about 825, according to his campaign. Asked by reporters about the strength of his support in the early-voting state, Biden said, \"I do feel pretty confident\". In a CNN interview airing Friday, Biden was asked about Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has called for Biden\\'s son Hunter to testify in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Trump has accused Hunter Biden of using his father\\'s influence to get a high-paying job on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and Democrats say Trump held up military aid to Ukraine to prompt an investigation into the Bidens. \"I am disappointed and quite frankly I\\'m angered,\" Biden said. \"(Graham) knows me. He knows my son. He knows there\\'s nothing to this. Trump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wouldn\\'t yield to\". Biden added: \"And Lindsey is about to go down in a way that I think he\\'s going to regret his whole life\". Biden joins Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, on the ballot for South Carolina\\'s Feb. 29 primary, the first in a Southern state. Several candidates including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, author Marianne Williamson and former tech executive Andrew Yang are campaigning in the state this weekend, and officials say some could be filing their paperwork. South Carolina\\'s filing deadline is Dec. 4. Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.

With stunning testimony largely complete, the House, the Senate and the president are swiftly moving on to next steps in the historic impeachment inquiry of Donald J. Trump. \"Frankly, I want a trial,\" Trump declared Friday, and it looks like he\\'s going to get it. Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff\\'s staff and others are compiling the panel\\'s findings. By early December, the Judiciary Committee is expected to launch its own high-wire hearings to consider articles of impeachment and a formal recommendation of charges. A vote by the full House could come by Christmas. A Senate trial would follow in 2020. Congress\\' impeachment inquiry, only the fourth in U.S. history, has stitched together what Democrats argue is a relatively simple narrative, of the president leveraging the office for personal political gain, despite Republicans\\' assertions that it\\'s complex, contradictory and unsupported by firsthand testimony. House Democrats may yet call additional witnesses first, notably John Bolton, Trump\\'s former national security adviser. But Senate Republicans are already looking ahead to their turn, the January trial that would follow House approval of impeachment charges. Should they try to dispatch with such a trial in short order, which they may not have the votes to do, despite holding 53 seats in the 100-member Senate. Or should they stretch it out, disrupting the Democrats\\' presidential primaries under the assumption that it helps more than hurts the GOP and Trump. At this point it seems very unlikely the 45th president will be removed from office. And he knows it. \"The Republican Party has never been more unified,\" Trump declared on Friday, calling in to the appropriately named \"Fox & Friends\" to talk about his achievements for nearly an hour. The Democrats haven\\'t got anything to impeach him on, he claimed, and if the House proceeds their work will come crashing down in the Senate. He wants that trial, he said. It all stems from Trump\\'s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\\'s newly elected president. In it, Trump asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for \"a favor,\" which involved investigating Democrat Joe Biden and a theory — debunked by U.S. intelligence — that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in America\\'s 2016 election. In return, Democrats say, it was made clear to Zelenskiy by others that he would get a coveted Oval Office visit. And at the same time, Trump was holding up $400 million in military aid the East European ally relies on to counter Russian aggression at its border. For Democrats, it amounts to nothing short of a quid pro quo \"bribery,\" spelled out in the Constitution as grounds for impeachment. They say they don\\'t need Bolton or anyone else to further a case they contend was well established by the White House\\'s rough transcript of the phone call — the transcript Trump himself implores America to read. \"We Democrats are tired of a president who is willing to put his own personal interests above the Constitution,\" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a Judiciary Committee member. \"I don\\'t think we should be waiting\". Trump insists he did nothing wrong and Friday revived the Ukraine interference idea, which he relies on it to push investigations of Biden\\'s son Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine. Trump\\'s former security aide Fiona Hill warned Republicans in Thursday\\'s hearing that it\\'s a \"false narrative \" dangerous for the U.S. and playing into Russia\\'s hands. Now Trump ally Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina, has asked the State Department for documents on the Bidens and Burisma, the gas company. The Judiciary Committee chairman and other senators met with White House Counsel Pat Cipollone as Republicans consider Trump\\'s rebuttal to whatever impeachment articles may arrive from the House. Another GOP Sen. Ted Cruz said if the White House wants to call Hunter Biden as a witness or the anonymous government whistleblower who alerted Congress to concerns about the phone call, \"I think they should be allowed to call them,\" he said on \"The Ben Shapiro Show\". Despite Trump\\'s denials, Democrat Schiff says the testimony in the hearings has largely confirmed the accusations against the president. \"What have we learned through these depositions and through the testimony?\" Schiff said as he gaveled the final session closed late Thursday. \"So much of this is undisputed\". Bolton hasn\\'t been questioned. Other testimony has him fuming at the White House over what he called the \"drug deal\" Trump\\'s team was \"cooking up\" over Ukraine. Bolton said he didn\\'t want to have any part of it and left his post in September, not long after the whistleblower filed the complaint. A former United Nations ambassador, Bolton declined a request to appear before Schiff\\'s committee, standing by the White House\\'s instructions not to comply with the probe. But he suddenly resurfaced Friday on Twitter. He said the White House had blocked and \"never returned access to my Twitter\". A senior Trump official said the White House did no such thing and wouldn\\'t even have the means to do so. There\\'s also Rudy Giuliani, the president\\'s lawyer, who witnesses put at the center of it all, fueling the theory of Ukraine\\'s role in election interference and enlisting diplomats like Ambassador Gordon Sondland to push the Ukrainians to announce the investigations. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week no decisions have been made on further hearings. \"As I said to the president, if you have any information that is exculpatory, please bring it forth, because it seems that the facts are uncontested as to what happened,\" she said. In the Senate, much of the next steps will depend on Trump, whose shifting views have forced GOP senators to readjust their own. They left the White House meeting without consensus but plan to meet again, according to a person familiar with the session. Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Mark Esper has fired the Navy\\'s top official, ending a stunning clash between President Donald Trump and top military leadership over the fate of a SEAL accused of war crimes in Iraq. Esper said Sunday that he had lost confidence in Navy Secretary Richard Spencer and alleged that Spencer proposed a deal with the White House behind his back to resolve the SEAL\\'s case. Trump has championed the matter of Navy Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, who was acquitted of murder in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive but convicted of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017. Spencer\\'s firing was a dramatic turn in the fast-changing and politically charged controversy. It exposed fissures in Trump\\'s relationship with the highest ranks of the U.S. military and raised questions about the appropriate role of a commander in chief in matters of military justice. Gallagher was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer after his conviction by a military jury. Trump, however, restored Gallagher\\'s rank this month. The situation escalated again in recent days. On Wednesday, the Navy had notified Gallagher that he would face a Navy SEAL review board to determine if he should be allowed to remain in the elite force. While Trump then tweeted that he would not allow the Navy to remove Gallagher from the SEALs by taking away his Trident Pin, which designates a SEAL member, the White House told the Navy it could proceed as planned, according to a Navy officer who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. That initially appeared to defuse the situation. The Navy SEAL review board was due to hear Gallagher\\'s case on Dec. 2. Spencer, speaking Saturday at an international security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said that he did not consider a tweet by Trump a formal order to stop the Navy review board. \"I need a formal order to act,\" Spencer said. He said of Trump\\'s tweets, \"I don\\'t interpret them as a formal order\". But on Sunday, Esper said he had learned that Spencer had \"privately\" proposed to the White House that Gallagher be allowed to retire in his current rank and without losing his status as a SEAL. Esper said Spencer had not told him of the proposal to the White House, causing him to lose \"trust and confidence\". A spokesperson for Spencer, Navy Cmdr. Sarah Higgins, said Spencer had no immediate comment. The White House did not provide details of Spencer\\'s alleged private proposal regarding Gallagher. In yet another twist, Esper also directed on Sunday that Gallagher be allowed to retire at the end of this month, and that the Navy review board that was scheduled to hear his case starting Dec. 2 be cancelled. At Esper\\'s direction, Gallagher will be allowed to retire as a SEAL at his current rank. That effectively gives Trump the outcome he sought. In a letter to Trump acknowledging \"my termination,\" Spencer said he had concluded that he and the president appear no longer to share the same understanding of \"the key principle of good order and discipline\". \"I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" he wrote. He did not cite a specific order. Chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Esper\\'s position had been that the Navy\\'s disciplinary process should be allowed to \"play itself out objectively and deliberately\". \"However, at this point, given the events of the last few days,\" Esper decided that Gallagher should be allowed to retain his SEAL status, Hoffman said. He said Esper had concluded that Gallagher could not, under the circumstances, receive a fair shake from the Navy. In the written statement, Esper said of Spencer: \"I am deeply troubled by this conduct shown by a senior DOD official. Unfortunately, as a result I have determined that Secretary Spencer no longer has my confidence to continue in his position. I wish Richard well\". Gallagher, speaking Sunday on \"Fox & Friends,\" alleged the Navy was acting in retaliation. \"They could have taken my Trident at any time they wanted,\" he said. \"Now they\\'re trying to take it after the president restored my rank\". Those who have their Trident pins removed will no longer be SEALs but could remain in the Navy. The Navy has revoked 154 Trident pins since 2011. Spencer, 65, had served as Navy secretary since August 2017. He was a Wall Street investment banker and is a veteran of the Marine Corps. He and Esper were Pentagon peers during the period that Esper served as Army secretary, prior to being sworn in as defense secretary last July. In a series of tweets Sunday evening, Trump said he had been unhappy with the Navy\\'s handling of the Gallagher case. \"Likewise, large cost overruns from past administration\\'s contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction,\" Trump added without specifics. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a statement saying Spencer \"did the right thing\" and \"should be proud of standing up to President Trump when he was wrong, something too many in this Administration and the Republican Party are scared to do. Good order, discipline, and morale among the Armed Services must transcend politics, and Secretary Spencer\\'s commitment to these principles with not be forgotten\". Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said Trump and Esper \"deserve to have a leadership team who has their trust and confidence\". He also acknowledged that he and Spencer had disagreed at times over the management of specific Navy programs. Trump said he\\'s nominating Kenneth Braithwaite, a retired Navy rear admiral and the current U.S. ambassador to Norway, to succeed Spencer. In a tweet, Trump called Braithwaite \"a man of great achievement and success\".WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump met Friday with athletes and coaches from 22 collegiate national championship teams. Traditional White House visits for champion college and pro sports teams have become politically loaded events during Trump\\'s presidency, and Friday\\'s gathering was no different. Elise Gout, a member of Columbia University\\'s 2019 championship fencing team, said she and three of her teammates had hoped to present Trump with the letter arguing that Trump has \"perpetuated a culture that conditions women and minority gender identities to be silent — to sacrifice the space they have every right to take up\". But Gout said the athletes were told by a Trump aide that they could not bring the letter with them during their brief meeting with Trump in the East Room of the White House. The letter stated it only represented the views of the four signatories, fencers who competed on the 2019 championship team and graduated earlier this year, and not Columbia University or the fencing team. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the Columbia fencers\\' visit with Trump was cordial, and White House staff extended an invitation for the athletes and coach to come back to the White House at a later date to discuss any policy concerns they have. Some athletes, including members of the World Cup-winning women\\'s national soccer team and Sean Doolittle from the World Series champion Washington Nationals, have declined the White House invitations from Trump. Others, like the NBA\\'s Golden State Warriors and the NFL\\'s Philadelphia Eagles, have been disinvited after players criticized the president. Others have warmly embraced Trump. The Columbia athletes\\' letter criticized the administration for proposing changes to federal rules that would affect campus sexual assault survivors and for implementing new regulations that prohibit groups that receive federal grants from referring patients for abortion. Trump, an avid golfer, spent a few moments with each team Friday, but he lingered a little bit longer with Stanford University\\'s men\\'s golf team. He invited all the champs to come take a peek at the Oval Office. \"So far, nobody\\'s turned that one down,\" Trump joked.WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House undertook a confidential review of documents that revealed extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for President Donald Trump\\'s decision to hold up military aid to Ukraine, the Washington Post reported Sunday. The Post, citing three people familiar with the records, said the research was conducted by the White House Counsel\\'s Office. Among the hundreds of documents found were email exchanges between acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House budget officials seeking to provide an explanation for the withholding of nearly $400 million in security assistance. The Post said a person briefed on the records examination said White House lawyers are expressing concern that the review turned up some unflattering and potentially embarrassing exchanges. But it was unclear if the records posed any legal problems for Trump. The Post said the three sources it spoke to did so on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations. The office of White House Counsel Pat Cipollone oversaw the records review. In early August email exchanges, Mulvaney asked Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, for an update on the legal rationale for withholding the aid to Ukraine and how much longer it could be delayed. Emails show that Vought and OMB staffers argued that withholding aid was legal while officials at the National Security Council and State Department protested. The aid was eventually released on Sept. 11. OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel told the Post that routine practices and procedures were followed and \"there was a legal consensus at every step of the way that money could be withheld to conduct the policy review\". A House panel is conducting an impeachment inquiry into the president\\'s actions on Ukraine. Democrats say Trump\\'s pressure on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden while withholding U.S. military aid to Kyiv may be grounds for removing him from office. Republicans have argued that the witnesses who have testified so far haven\\'t provided firsthand knowledge of the president committing bribery. Trump and GOP leaders have labeled the inquiry an attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a Maryland man\\'s bid for a new trial based on information uncovered by the hit podcast \"Serial\". The justices did not comment in leaving in place a 4-3 ruling by Maryland\\'s highest court that denied a new trial to Adnan Syed, who was convicted of strangling a high school classmate he had once dated. Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of killing 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. Prosecutors said during his trial that Syed killed her after she broke off their relationship. Syed\\'s lawyers had argued that his trial lawyer\\'s failure to investigate an alibi witness violated his right to competent legal representation. \"We are deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court but by no means is this the end of Adnan Syed,\" defense attorney C. Justin Brown told The Associated Press. \"There are other legal options and we are exploring each and every one of them\". Millions of people learned about Syed when the hit podcast \"Serial\" dedicated its entire first season to the case in 2014. The show shattered podcast-streaming and downloading records, shining a spotlight that led to renewed court proceedings. Two Maryland courts found that Syed deserved a new trial. His lawyer during his first trial, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to contact a woman who said she saw Syed at a library at the time prosecutors say he strangled his ex-girlfriend in 1999. Gutierrez has since died. But in 2018, the Maryland Court of Appeals denied Syed a new trial, even though it agreed his trial lawyer\\'s work was lacking. The state high court said there was little chance the outcome would have been different had Gutierrez done what she should have. Rabia Chaudry, an attorney and friend of Syed\\'s family who first brought his case to the attention of \"This American Life,\" which developed the podcast, said Monday that the Supreme Court\\'s decision \"was fully expected\". She said his defense team has been preparing to file either a habeas petition in federal court or go back to the state court. \"We were just waiting. It was just a technicality. Now it\\'s done, so we can move forward,\" she said of the high court\\'s move. \"He is doing fine. He is hanging in there. He knows that none of us are basically giving up. He was a great legal team. He was a lot of public support and walking away is not an option\". Garcia Cano reported from Baltimore.CHICAGO (AP) — As a young scholar, Elizabeth Warren traveled to federal courthouses, studying families overwhelmed by debt. She brought along a photocopier, gathering reams of statistics as she tried to answer one question: Why were these folks going bankrupt. Warren, then a law professor, wasn\\'t satisfied with textbook explanations; she wanted to hear directly from people drowning in debt. So she sat in courtrooms, listening to one hard-luck story after another. She interviewed lawyers and judges, duplicated bankruptcy filings on a sturdy copier — nicknamed R2-D2 — that she hauled around to save printing costs. And she was joined in her research by two professor-colleagues who teamed with her to study those documents and build a database. Warren had suspected bankruptcy court might be a last stop for deadbeats, or maybe the very poor. Instead, she discovered mostly middle-class people, many of them homeowners with college degrees who\\'d suffered one bad break — an illness, a divorce, a job loss. It was the kind of cruel twist that seemed all too familiar: When Warren was 12 years old, her father, a carpet salesman, had a heart attack. The family\\'s station wagon was repossessed, and her mother went to work in a minimum-wage job at Sears to pay the bills. Warren\\'s foray into bankruptcy was the first step in a four-decade journey that has come to define her public profile and shape her worldview. As a law professor, bankruptcy expert, consumer watchdog, Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate, Warren has consistently championed economic reforms — with mixed results — to boost the middle class. \"The American middle class was in a lot more trouble than anyone had previously thought,\" she told The Associated Press, describing her research, \"and year by year, the stories have gotten worse. The game has become a little more tilted and a little more tilted against hardworking families\". Warren has carved out a niche as a merciless critic of credit card companies, big banks, lobbyists and Wall Street financiers, blaming them for policies and practices she has labeled as predatory, greedy or corrupt. At the same time, she cites her bankruptcy studies for revealing the real damage caused by these economic forces. It ultimately led to her prescient warnings about the economic collapse of 2008. And she continues to point to her focus on the middle class as she warns of another on the horizon. \"I\\'ve spent most of my career getting to the bottom of what\\'s happening to working families in America,\" Warren recently wrote in a post titled \"The Coming Economic Crash and How to Stop It\". Warren\\'s own childhood was steeped in financial insecurity. She often describes her Oklahoma upbringing as \"the ragged edge of the middle class\". After her father recovered, he found work as a janitor. But there wasn\\'t money for college until Elizabeth Herring — the youngest of four and the only girl — parlayed her champion debating skills into a full scholarship. She married at 19, became a mother at 22, divorced and remarried. After a brief stint as a speech therapist, she changed careers, attended Rutgers Law School and eventually landed a job at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. She asked to teach bankruptcy, she recalled in \"A Fighting Chance,\" her memoir, because she wanted to know what led people to \"the edge of disaster,\" but thought the question seemed too personal to ask openly. Bankruptcy law can seem dense and dry, but Warren saw pain, guilt and hope among those filing into bankruptcy court. The prospect of second chances appealed to her, as she later explained to one of her students at Harvard Law School. U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a Massachusetts Democrat, recalls sitting in her office one day asking her to explain some nuance of the bankruptcy code. \"I turned to her at one point and said, \\'You know, you could have taught anything. Why on God\\'s green earth did you possibly pick bankruptcy?\\'\" recalls Kennedy, who has endorsed Warren\\'s candidacy. \"And I still remember the answer. She said because it\\'s about the way in which people can get to pick themselves up and we help them start again after they fall\". It wasn\\'t just the topic but how Warren and her colleagues pursued their research that set them apart. Their work began in the early 1980s, when legal scholars tended to focus on businesses and academic papers. But Warren joined two university colleagues in Austin — Jay Westbrook, a law professor and bankruptcy expert, and Teresa Sullivan, a sociologist — for an on-the-ground study. They visited bankruptcy courts in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas. In research that continued over the decade, the three read through more than 1,500 bankruptcy filings, interviewed hundreds facing financial ruin and analyzed the findings from the database. At the time, the bankruptcy rate was doubling and some experts thought debtors were reckless spenders; one study found almost a third of the people in bankruptcy could have repaid a significant part of their debts. Warren was skeptical, too. \"I knew that my family had been through a lot of tough times, but nobody had actually declared bankruptcy,\" she recalled in the interview. But those suspicions were dismissed after she and her colleagues discovered many debtors\\' lives had been upended by things beyond their control. She saw that in questionnaires in which debtors explained why they\\'d filed for bankruptcy. In her memoir, Warren recalls one unforgettable response: \"Wife died of cancer. Left $65,000 in medical bills after insurance. worked five part-time jobs to meet rent, utilities, phone, food and insurance\". Some of Warren\\'s friends from her Texas days speculate her political allegiances shifted because she saw her own family in these struggles. Before her Harvard years, she was registered as an independent, then a Republican and finally a Democrat in 1996. Westbrook says he and Warren didn\\'t talk much about politics during their research, but he assumed she was a moderate Republican who turned more progressive, rejecting a creditor-friendly view that debtors were largely responsible for their predicament. The more they learned, he says, the more they identified with those coming to court. \"They were sort of the middle-class people that could have been our parents or the people next door,\" he says. Warren and her Texas colleagues summed up their findings in a book, \"As We Forgive Our Debtors: Bankruptcy and Consumer Credit in America\". Warren\\'s credentials as a bankruptcy expert brought her to Washington. In 1995, she was appointed by a former Oklahoma congressman — he and Warren were high school debating acquaintances — to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. Two years later, the panel proposed a series of recommendations to Congress, including strengthening the ability to collect child support from those who\\'ve filed for bankruptcy and standardizing how much property could be kept by a bankrupt family and under what conditions. Warren\\'s focus remained on families caught in an economic squeeze. In 2003, she joined her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, to write \"The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are (Still) Going Broke\". One conclusion: \"Having a child now is the single best predictor that a woman will end up in financial disaster\". That book thrust Warren into the TV spotlight — both mother and daughter appeared on \"Dr. Phil\" — but growing scrutiny of her research brought out the critics, too. In 2005, Warren was part of a team that published a study that had surveyed nearly 1,800 people who\\'d filed for bankruptcy in five federal courts and found nearly half cited medical causes. But a group of researchers that analyzed that data concluded medical bills contributed to just 17% of personal bankruptcies and said those affected tended to be closer to poverty rather than the middle class. In a rebuttal, Warren\\'s team said their critics had ignored large parts of the debtors\\' own reports of their financial troubles and unfairly portrayed them as deadbeats. Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern, is among those who disagree with Warren\\'s conclusions about medical bankruptcy. \"If you ask any economist — pick one at random, show them the study — the statistical methods are not sound,\" he says. \"I don\\'t think that Sen. Warren has the tools to correctly write that study from her training. for the same reason I don\\'t write law articles\". Garthwaite says the findings exaggerate the degree to which medical bills are responsible for bankruptcy. \"Are you getting at the causal role of medical debt in bankruptcy or simply the presence of medical debt of those who go bankrupt? These are hard questions to answer. Just because a number is big doesn\\'t make it right\". He also says the Warren team\\'s results have been used as talking points by progressive policymakers to argue for increased government regulation of the health care sector, \"Obamacare\" and \"Medicare for All\". Warren cited her research to bolster her fight against bankruptcy legislation — first pushed in the late 1990s by banks and credit card companies — that would make it harder for people to erase their debts. Proponents argued this was a necessary step because too many people who could afford to repay their debts were filing for bankruptcy. In 2002, Warren wrote a New York Times op-ed that maintained the legislation would be particularly devastating to women, who far outnumbered men when filing for bankruptcy. She called out then-Sen. Joe Biden, who supported the measure, noting many banks and credit card companies were incorporated in his home state of Delaware. Warren remained a fierce opponent for seven years, maintaining that the legislation would impose new pressures on people who weren\\'t irresponsible, just unlucky. In a 2005 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that has since gone viral, Warren clashed with Biden in sometimes-tense exchanges over bankruptcy courts, credit card companies and interest rates. At one point, Biden called Warren\\'s argument \"mildly demagogic\" and said her problem was not with the bankruptcy bill but with credit card company usury rates. Warren replied: \"If you\\'re not going to fix that problem, you can\\'t take away the last shred of protection from these families\". To which Biden responded: \"I got it. OK. You\\'re very good, professor\". Warren likened the bill\\'s passage to losing a David vs. Goliath battle. \"David really did get the slingshot shoved down his throat sideways,\" she wrote in her memoir. \"It hurt then, and it still hurts now\". And it was not to be forgotten. When Biden announced his presidential bid in April, Warren immediately reminded the public they were opponents in the bankruptcy wars, declaring the former vice president had chosen credit card companies over \"millions of hardworking families\". Warren\\'s willingness to challenge Biden or other Democrats doesn\\'t surprise friends or former colleagues. Lynn LoPucki, a professor at the UCLA School of Law who has co-written several legal texts with Warren, says the senator has long been outspoken and blunt. \"She doesn\\'t have a public persona and then say something different in private,\" he says. Warren is also known for her folksy manner — uttering an occasional \"golly gee\" or \"holy cow\" — and her skill at translating arcane financial terms into everyday language. \"She\\'s really effective in communicating with the public, which most academics are not,\" says Michael Barr, dean of the Gerald Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan who met Warren when he was a top Treasury Department official in the Obama administration. \"I think she has a real way of connecting with ordinary families\". Warren was equally adept at educating senators and staff on Capitol Hill, says Melissa Jacoby, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who was an attorney on the 1995 bankruptcy commission. \"Elizabeth can take a very complicated set of rules that most people think has nothing to do with their lives and in a small amount of time explain why they should care very deeply about it,\" Jacoby says. \"She\\'s always been really good at. telling important stories and bringing out important themes, but also having the head for all the underlying data\". Warren moved from bankruptcy into consumer advocacy shortly after the 2008 election as the nation\\'s financial system was on the brink of collapse. Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tapped her to be on a congressional oversight panel to monitor the $700 billion bank bailout package. Warren used her new platform to lobby for a program she\\'d first proposed years earlier that seemed particularly timely: the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog agency that would better regulate mortgages, student loans, credit cards and other financial products. After much political wrangling, the bureau was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Though President Barack Obama asked Warren to set up the agency, Republican opposition prevented her from getting the director\\'s job. But Warren was back in Washington a few years later — as a U.S. senator. At age 63, she won her first race for public office, ousting Republican Sen. Scott Brown. Now as a presidential candidate, Warren is on the campaign trail with a long list of policy proposals and a call for structural changes in the government. In her memoir, she lamented her frustration a decade earlier chairing the bailout panel that \"couldn\\'t change a system that seemed hell-bent on protecting the big guys and leaving everyone else on the side of the road\". But she also said that experience taught her an important lesson:. \"When you have no real power, go public, really public. The public is where the real power is\".

They\\'re moving \"expeditiously\" ahead as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has instructed. In the coming weeks, the House intelligence panel will submit a report to the Judiciary panel, and then Democrats will consider drafting articles of impeachment on President Donald Trump\\'s dealings with Ukraine and the administration\\'s attempts to block the investigation. The articles could cover matters beyond Trump\\'s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Democrats, including special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, but no decisions have been made. There could be several steps along the way, including a Judiciary committee vote, a House floor vote and, finally, a Senate trial. What\\'s next in impeachment:. INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WRAPS UP. Democrats on the House intelligence committee believe they have enough evidence to write a report and move forward. But it\\'s still unclear whether they will hear any last-minute testimony. Democratic House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday he won\\'t foreclose the possibility of his committee undertaking more depositions and hearings in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. Schiff said on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" that his committee continues to conduct investigative work, but he won\\'t let the Trump administration stall the inquiry. Schiff\\'s staff and others are compiling the panel\\'s findings to submit to the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to open its own hearings to consider articles of impeachment and a formal recommendation of charges. He said his committee may need to file addendums to its report so that the Judiciary Committee can move ahead. \"The investigation isn\\'t going to end,\" Schiff said. Several potentially key witnesses — former national security adviser John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, among others — have declined to provide testimony or documents on Trump\\'s orders. Democrats have said they don\\'t want to get tied up in lengthy court battles to force those witnesses to cooperate with subpoenas. But they could still hear testimony if one of them changed their mind, or if other key witnesses emerged. \"We\\'ve heard and seen compelling evidence that the president committed serious wrongdoing,\" says Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the intelligence panel. \"There are other witnesses, including some principal witnesses that we would have liked to have heard from, but the evidence has been pretty damning that the president committed an impeachable act\". Time is running short if the House is to vote on impeachment by Christmas, which Democrats privately say is the goal. The intelligence panel is expected to spend the Thanksgiving week writing, and maybe even completing, a report of evidence gathered through more than six weeks of closed-door depositions and public hearings. Once the report is done, the panel could vote to pass it on to the House Judiciary Committee. That could happen as soon as the first week of December, when lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving break. JUDICIARY TAKES CHARGE. Pelosi has instructed the intelligence panel, along with other committees that have investigated Trump, to submit evidence to the House Judiciary Committee. That panel is then expected to hold hearings and vote on articles of impeachment — a process that could take up the first two weeks of December. The articles of impeachment are expected to mostly focus on Ukraine, though discussions continue. Democrats are considering an overall \"abuse of power\" article against Trump, which could be broken into categories like bribery or extortion. The article would center on the Democrats\\' assertion, based on witness testimony, that Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine into politically motivated investigations. Additional articles of impeachment could include obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. The latter could incorporate evidence from Mueller\\'s report. HOUSE FLOOR VOTE. The Judiciary panel could take several days to debate the articles and then vote on them — sending impeachment to the House floor, where they could immediately be called up for consideration. Debate on impeachment would be handled similarly to any other bill or resolution. If articles of impeachment reach the House floor, Democrats will be looking to peel off Republicans to make the vote bipartisan. So far, however, it appears few, if any, Republicans will break ranks. Not a single Republican backed the resolution launching the impeachment hearings. Once an impeachment vote is done, Democrats would appoint impeachment managers for a Senate trial. House Democrats are hoping to be finished with an impeachment vote by Christmas, sending articles to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial in 2020. Unless political dynamics change, Trump is expected to have the backing of majority Republicans in that chamber to be acquitted. It\\'s still unclear how long a trial would last, what it would look like or what witnesses might be called. Top White House officials met Thursday with Republican senators to discuss strategy but made no decisions about the length of a trial or other tactics, two people familiar with the session said. Participants in the meeting expressed more interest in voting as soon as they have the 51 votes needed to acquit Trump than in setting a specific timetable for the proceedings, according to one Senate GOP aide. That aide and a senior White House official said a trial lasting two weeks was discussed, but not agreed to. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting.

The justices rejected an appeal Monday from the daughter of one of three people shot to death by a man who illegally bought a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition from someone he met through Armslist.com. The Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed the suit, ruling that federal law protects website operators from liability for posting content from a third party. The state court rejected arguments that websites that enable gun deals must take reasonable care to prevent sales to people prohibited from purchasing firearms. The Wisconsin shooter was under a court order that prohibited him from possessing guns. A similar lawsuit filed by a Boston police officer is pending in state court in Massachusetts.NEW YORK (AP) — At another time in history, the indictment of two jail guards responsible for monitoring Jeffrey Epstein the night he killed himself might have served as an emphatic rebuttal to suspicions that the wealthy sex offender was actually murdered. Not in 2019. Conspiracy theories continued to flourish, even after prosecutors took pains to point out the ample evidence backing a medical examiner\\'s determination that Epstein hanged himself. Video surveillance confirmed, they said in a news release and an indictment, that nobody had entered the area where Epstein was locked in his cell. The locked door to the unit, they said, could only be opened remotely by an officer in the jail\\'s control center, plus there was a second locked door to which only correctional officers assigned to the high-security housing unit had the key. Epstein had no roommate, they said, and had died alone. Social media buzzed with \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself\" memes, fueled by the financier\\'s past associations with Britain\\'s Prince Andrew and U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. \"People aren\\'t buying the suicide story,\" said one tweet. \"Epstein is alive on a beach somewhere in the middle east,\" said another. Democrats and Republicans — and even Epstein\\'s family and his alleged victims — were united in skepticism that Epstein could have taken his own life a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. At a news conference Thursday, lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents several women who say they were sexually abused by Epstein, said there remains quite a few \"suspicious circumstances surrounding his death\". Dr. Michael Baden, the forensic pathologist hired by Epstein\\'s family to observe his autopsy, also remains incredulous, saying he wanted to hear from the guards before deciding whether it was suicide or homicide. Eric Oliver, a University of Chicago professor who studies conspiracy theories, said no amount of evidence presented by government authorities is likely to change some people\\'s minds. \"When there\\'s already this kind of profound mistrust of the political system, of political institutions, of the media, any kind of official channel that seeks to overturn this belief is likely to be viewed with suspicion,\" he said. Oliver said a survey he conducted two weeks ago found that 30% of respondents believed Epstein\\'s death was a homicide. Most conspiracy theories gain traction with less than 20% of respondents, he said. The Trump-perpetuated theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. peaked at about 24%. The Epstein conspiracy theories also cut across the ideological spectrum, Oliver said, in part because they speak to concerns some Americans have about concentrations of wealth and power: feeling that the wealthy have amassed too much political power. \"The idea that somehow or another they were able to sneak into his jail cell and murder him speaks to both that power — that they\\'re somehow or another above the law — and the nefariousness of their intentions, that they\\'d be willing to murder some guy who could potentially expose the wealthy,\" Oliver said. The two corrections officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center charged in connection with Epstein\\'s Aug. 10 death are accused of the relatively mundane crime of falsifying prison logs. Guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas were supposed to be checking on Epstein every half-hour. But prosecutors said they shirked that duty and were instead sleeping or surfing the internet for bargains on furniture and motorcycles, and Epstein \"committed suicide overnight while unobserved\". The guards have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail. Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press this week that he initially had his own suspicions about Epstein\\'s death but came to the conclusion that failures by the jail\\'s staff had allowed Epstein to take his own life. \"I can understand people who immediately, whose minds went to sort of the worst-case scenario because it was a perfect storm of screw-ups,\" Barr said. The phrase \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself\" has taken on a life of its own — sometimes more as a pop culture catchphrase than an actual belief. It has shown up on a screen at San Diego\\'s airport, on a California brewery\\'s beer cans and as the name of a new Michigan brew. This month, a former Navy SEAL appearing on Fox News blurted, \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself,\" during an unrelated interview. Last week, a man tried to register for a spot on the New Hampshire primary ballot as Rod \"Epstein Didn\\'t Kill Himself\" Webber. On Monday, the day before the officers were charged, a woman who says Epstein sexually assaulted her when she was 15 wore a bracelet to a news conference that spelled out: \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself\". Even members of Congress got in on the act. U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., spelled out the phrase with the first letter of each in a series of 23 tweets last week. At a prison oversight hearing on Tuesday, U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said drywall, Christmas ornaments and Epstein were \"three things that don\\'t hang themselves\". \"That\\'s what the American people think, and they deserve some answers,\" the Louisiana Republican said. Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, the new director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said during that oversight hearing that Epstein\\'s death was \"a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons\". But in an exchange with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, she reiterated that it was a suicide. \"Do you have any evidence to suggest otherwise?\" Graham asked. \"I do not,\" Hawk Sawyer said.

The state party\\'s chairman, William McCurdy II, and the DNC chairman, Tom Perez, intend to hold a conference call on Monday to announce the approval of the plan, the party confirmed. Besides offering four days of early voting, Nevada\\'s plan calls for releasing raw vote totals from the caucus, offering caucus materials in Tagalog for the state\\'s growing Filipino population and having caucus workers use an app instead of paper to record and transmit results to party officials. \"The primary goal in crafting this plan was to ensure as many Nevada Democrats as possible are given the opportunity to make their voice heard and I believe we will do that in 2020,\" McCurdy said in a statement. \"Nevada plays a critical role in the presidential primary and we take our role as an early state incredibly serious\". The shift in Nevada, which votes third in the Democratic presidential primary, comes as Democrats have been encouraging state parties to find ways to increase participation in caucuses or instead hold primaries. Traditional caucuses require voters show up in person at neighborhood sites at a specific time and break into groups to demonstrate their support for their chosen candidate. Critics have said the format is difficult for people to participate in, especially if they\\'re homebound, have to work or have young children. To allow for an alternate way to participate, Nevada and fellow early voting state Iowa had sought earlier this year to allow people to vote in their 2020 caucuses over the telephone. But DNC officials rejected the plan in August, citing security concerns. Nevada is instead relying on four days of early voting to boost turnout, running Feb. 15-18. The early results will be kept confidential until vote totals are released from the state\\'s main caucuses on Feb. 22. The early voting will be an abbreviated version of the in-person meetings, allowing Democrats to stop by caucus sites and fill out forms listing their preferred candidate and up to four alternatives. It\\'s unclear whether campaigns will try to encourage early caucusing to lock in support sooner, but the changes likely will force the candidates to spread their intense get-out-the-vote push into multiple days. The DNC also has signed off on Nevada Democrats\\' plan to have workers running the caucus meetings use an app to tabulate results, determine if a candidate has enough support and calculate how many delegates they\\'ve earned. The app will report the results to the Nevada State Democratic Party. In past years, results were recorded by hand on paper and transmitted to the party headquarters via telephone and mail. The party plans to release more information about the app in the coming weeks.

A who\\'s who of highly respected military and civilian information technology executives from the Dept. of Defense and throughout the U.S. government today released a detailed report in cooperation with the IT Acquisition Advisory Council (IT-AAC), calling out the troubled Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) proposal for diverging in most key areas from DoD\\'s highly regarded Cloud Strategy. While the executives and former military officers are strong proponents of the new DoD Cloud Strategy adopted in December 2018, today\\'s report laid out six critical ways in which the JEDI proposal either ignores or specifically diverges from the Cloud Strategy and calls for JEDI to be rescinded and revised. The report is posted at www.IT-AAC.org. The military IT experts and CIOs are:. They jointly drafted and signed this letter accompanying the report to the Acting Secretary and CIO of the Defense Dept., Congressional Armed Services committees and the White House. \"Where the JEDI RFP stipulates a single, static cloud solution, the DoD Cloud Strategy outlines a rich environment including multiple cloud solutions. The Cloud Strategy demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the security challenges facing DoD that is absent from the JEDI RFP,\" the report points out. Additionally, the report pointed out that: \"The Strategy recognizes the central role that Software as a Service (SaaS) will play in the DoD IT ecosystem, yet SaaS is entirely absent from the JEDI RFP. The JEDI RFP treats cloud at the tactical edge as an integral part of a cloud service and makes no long-term provisions for building out tactical cloud, two technical and architectural mistakes which are not repeated in the Strategy\". DOD\\'s excellent Cloud Strategy is posted at https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/04/2002085866/-1/-1/1/DOD-CLOUD-STRATEGY.PDF. \"The national security implications of the content of this IT-AAC JEDI Report are fundamental to how the Department of Defense will effectively move toward information sharing in the 21st century. This report succinctly identifies concerns that should be addressed before the JEDI award,\" states LTG Deptula, USAF Ret. Beyond those items, the report also noted:. Call for Action.

Housing Is A Human Right ( HHR ), the housing advocacy division of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation ( AHF ) is honored to receive the endorsement of presidential candidate and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, for the Rental Affordability Act. The Rental Affordability Act would expand the possibility of rent control for up to 13 million Californians. As the state suffers through a historic housing affordability and homelessness crisis, the RAA offers a path to keeping families in their homes and protecting renters from speculative Wall St. landlords, who see housing as an investment and a tool for limitless profit. \"We look forward to working with Senator Sanders on advocating for the passage of the Rental Affordability Act next November,\" said Campaign Director, René Christian Moya. \"For his entire career, Bernie has stood up for working people, and he\\'s been a stalwart advocate for the expansion of rent control laws nationwide on his presidential campaign\". \"I strongly support the Rental Affordability Act,\" said Senator Sanders. \"This initiative will allow California cities to pass sensible limits on rent increases and protect families, seniors and veterans from skyrocketing rents. I was born and raised in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. That most minimal form of economic security was crucial for our family, but today that type of economic security does not exist for millions of Americans. That has got to change\". \"We thank Senator Sanders for his endorsement of the Rental Affordability Act and for recognizing the importance of this ballot measure as a practical means to address housing affordability, one of the most important social justice issues of our day,\" said Michael Weinstein, President of AHF.

PUB: 10/23/2019 12:00 PM/DISC: 10/23/2019 12:00 PM. http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191023005602/en.WASHINGTON (AP) — After two weeks of public hearings, Democrats could soon turn the impeachment process over to the House Judiciary Committee. They\\'re moving \"expeditiously\" ahead as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has instructed. At some point in the coming weeks, the House intelligence panel will submit a report to the Judiciary panel, and then Democrats will consider drafting articles of impeachment on President Donald Trump\\'s dealings with Ukraine and the administration\\'s attempts to block the investigation. The articles could cover matters beyond Trump\\'s efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Democrats, including special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, but no decisions have been made. There could be several steps along the way, including a Judiciary committee vote, a House floor vote and, finally, a Senate trial. What\\'s next in impeachment:. INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WRAPS UP. Democrats on the House intelligence committee believe they have enough evidence to write a report and move forward. But it\\'s still unclear whether they will hear any last-minute testimony. Several potentially key witnesses — former National Security Adviser John Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, among others — have so far declined to provide testimony or documents on Trump\\'s orders. Democrats have said they don\\'t want to get tied up in lengthy court battles to force those witnesses to cooperate with subpoenas. But they could still hear testimony if one of them changed their mind, or if other key witnesses emerged. \"We\\'ve heard and seen compelling evidence that the president committed serious wrongdoing,\" says Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, a member of the intelligence panel. \"There are other witnesses, including some principal witnesses that we would have liked to have heard from, but the evidence has been pretty damning that the president committed an impeachable act\". Time is running short if the House is to vote on impeachment by Christmas, which Democrats privately say is the goal. The intelligence panel is expected to spend the Thanksgiving week writing, and maybe even completing, a report of evidence gathered through more than six weeks of closed-door depositions and public hearings. Once the report is done, the panel could vote to pass it on to the House Judiciary Committee. That could happen as soon as the first week of December, when lawmakers return from the Thanksgiving break. JUDICIARY TAKES CHARGE. Pelosi has instructed the intelligence panel, along with other committees that have investigated Trump, to submit evidence to the House Judiciary Committee. That panel is then expected to hold hearings and vote on articles of impeachment — a process that could take up the first two weeks of December. The articles of impeachment are expected to mostly focus on Ukraine, though discussions continue. Democrats are considering an overall \"abuse of power\" article against Trump, which could be broken into categories like bribery or extortion. The article would center on the Democrats\\' assertion, based on witness testimony, that Trump used his office to pressure Ukraine into politically motivated investigations. Additional articles of impeachment could include obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. The latter could incorporate evidence from Mueller\\'s report. HOUSE FLOOR VOTE. The Judiciary panel could take several days to debate the articles and then vote on them — sending impeachment to the House floor, where they could immediately be called up for consideration. Debate on impeachment would be handled similarly to any other bill or resolution. If articles of impeachment reach the House floor, Democrats will be looking to peel off Republicans to make the vote bipartisan. So far, however, it appears few, if any, Republicans will break ranks. Not a single Republican backed the resolution launching the impeachment hearings. Once an impeachment vote is done, Democrats would appoint impeachment managers for a Senate trial. House Democrats are hoping to be finished with an impeachment vote by Christmas, sending articles to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial in 2020. Unless political dynamics change, Trump is expected to have the backing of majority Republicans in that chamber to be acquitted. It\\'s still unclear how long a trial would last, what it would look like or what witnesses might be called. Top White House officials met Thursday with Republican senators to discuss strategy but made no decisions about the length of a trial other tactics, two people familiar with the session said. Participants in the meeting expressed more interest in voting as soon as they have the 51 votes needed to acquit Trump than in setting a specific timetable for the proceedings, according to one Senate GOP aide. That aide and a senior White House official said a trial lasting two weeks was discussed, but not agreed to. The aides spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting. Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.NEW LONDON, N.H. (AP) — Amy Klobuchar does not want to run for president as a \"woman candidate\". That\\'s never been the Minnesota Democrat\\'s style. But the media, public opinion polls and the addition of more men to an already crowded 2020 primary race led the three-term senator to a conclusion: Many Americans still aren\\'t comfortable with the idea of a woman in the Oval Office, and she needed to amplify the conversation about it. So in interviews, on the debate stage and before overflow crowds at weekend town halls in New Hampshire, Klobuchar has been talking more pointedly about gender and politics — even if she\\'d rather be discussing her record of winning even in Republican areas or the more than 100 bills she\\'s passed. \"Our people want to win. And if they think \\'Oh, can a woman really win?\\' you gotta start discussing that. But it\\'s not the theme of why I should win,\" Klobuchar said. \"I want to run on my merits\". President Donald Trump\\'s 2016 election sparked a new level of activism among women, who marched by the millions and ran for – and won – elections in record numbers. Female voters who abandoned Trump\\'s GOP, particularly in suburban areas, also fueled Democratic gains in longtime Republican places. Now Democrats see those voters as critical to unseating Trump in 2020. And yet second-guessing by some Democrats about who can defeat Trump and the memory of Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 loss have created an ever-present additional challenge for the record number of women seeking the party\\'s nomination. Of the six major female candidates who entered the race, only one — Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — is polling among the four-person top tier. The one who ran most overtly as a feminist and mom, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, has dropped out. The issue may be especially important at this stage of the race for Klobuchar, who\\'s polling in fifth place and has been battling two men with better poll numbers and more money — former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — for the primary\\'s moderate lane. And just as she\\'s been slowly but steadily gaining momentum in recent weeks, the competition got even tougher. Billionaire Michael Bloomberg entered the race Sunday as another moderate alternative to Biden. He\\'s spending $30 million on a round of TV ads, roughly double what Klobuchar raised in the first three quarters of this year. Klobuchar was critical of Bloomberg\\'s decision to get in the race but said her campaign is moving forward the way she has always operated – working hard, talking with voters and spending money conservatively to be sure she has enough to keep going. She\\'s invested a significant portion of her time and money in Iowa, the first caucus state, and is adding New Hampshire staff at a time when some campaigns are cutting or redeploying them. Last week she announced new hires and her first office in Nevada, the third state to vote, and her campaign plans to announce new staff this week in South Carolina, site of the South\\'s first primary. Meanwhile she\\'s tweaked her message to more directly address voters\\' doubts, sometimes in subtle ways so as not to alienate those voters she says can be turned off by too much talk of being a woman. That\\'s a lesson she learned early in her political career, when Klobuchar watched others run as \"woman candidates\" who tried to make their gender a selling point — and lost. In a TV interview and again at Wednesday\\'s debate she argued that a woman with the same resume as Buttigieg wouldn\\'t make the debate stage — adding that she believes the 37-year-old veteran and mayor of South Bend, Indiana is qualified to be president. She told debate viewers who wonder if a woman can beat Trump that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"does it every day\" — drawing thunderous applause from the audience. In New Hampshire last weekend Klobuchar, who is 5 feet, 4 inches tall, talked about feeling short on the debate stage. She laughed about the talk of her hair moving during last week\\'s debate — the result, she said, of an air vent directed on her and not enough hairspray, adding \"welcome to the life of a woman candidate\". She peppered speeches about her record and her policy proposals with references to strong women, from Russia expert Fiona Hill and Ambassador Marie Yavonovitch testifying at last week\\'s impeachment hearings to New Hampshire\\'s two female senators and female governors elected last year in places like Michigan and Kansas. \"The message wasn\\'t about \\'Hey, elect me because I\\'m the first woman,\\'\" Klobuchar said following an event at Colby-Sawyer College, where the crowd of several hundred spilled into an overflow room and out the front door. \"The message was \\'Step back and think about what your image is of a president, because we\\'re never going to get to that point of being the president, if you can\\'t think of it differently.\\' Because we don\\'t look like, you know, Abraham Lincoln\". Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod, who was a senior adviser to Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign, said Klobuchar is \"the perfect person to bring this up,\" because she\\'s known for her pragmatism and Midwestern common sense, and because she isn\\'t a front-runner. \"The thing we all love about Amy is she\\'s authentic,\" Elrod said. \"She may tick off some people, but those are people who probably wouldn\\'t vote for her anyway. But we need to hear this message\". Klobuchar\\'s remarks to a crowd Saturday in Lebanon, New Hampshire, were enough to convince retired children\\'s librarian Joanne Scobie. Klobuchar had been in her list of top three candidates, but Scobie had been hesitant to choose Klobuchar over Biden or Buttigieg because she feared other people might not support a woman. She left Saturday\\'s event committed to voting for Klobuchar. \"I think she would be great on stage with Trump,\" Scobie said. Her husband, Bob Scobie, wasn\\'t as confident that Americans would accept a female president. But he was \"much, much, much more interested\" after seeing Klobuchar speak in person. But also lingering over Klobuchar\\'s campaign since before she joined the race in February have been reports that she has mistreated her staff. While Klobuchar has acknowledged she can be a tough boss, her supporters have argued the anonymous accounts are another example of sexism facing female leaders. Julia Howk, 79, said those stories concern some of her friends. But after hearing Klobuchar speak at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, Howk said she found her to be down-to-earth, funny and smart. She liked that Klobuchar isn\\'t promising things she believes are unrealistic, such as free college for all, and said it\\'s clear the candidate \"speaks her mind,\" which Howk also found appealing. \"I don\\'t think that (former President Lyndon) Johnson was a particularly delicate guy,\" she added. Others aren\\'t sold for reasons that have nothing to do with gender. Ashley Babladelis and Audrey Redmond, both 33, said they\\'re more liberal than Klobuchar on issues such as health care and gun rights. That may mean they support Warren or California Sen. Kamala Harris instead. \"I\\'m very passionate about seeing a woman in the White House,\" Babladelis said. \"I don\\'t know that Amy is that woman\".

Schiff said on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" that his committee continues to conduct investigative work, but he won\\'t let the Trump administration stall the inquiry. Schiff\\'s staff and others are compiling the panel\\'s findings to submit to the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to open its own hearings to consider articles of impeachment and a formal recommendation of charges. He said his committee may need to file addendums to its report so that the Judiciary Committee can move ahead. \"The investigation isn\\'t going to end,\" Schiff said. Democrats argue that the president leveraged his office for personal political gain. Trump had $391 million in congressionally approved U.S. assistance withheld from Ukraine from July to September and pushed Ukraine to launch investigations into political rivals. But Republicans contend that the allegation he sought to bribe Ukraine is unsupported by firsthand testimony. The ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, said on Fox News \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that public hearings over the past two weeks have drawn in many Americans who don\\'t normally follow cable news. He said the hearings showed House Republicans are serious legislators and were \"nothing but a total disaster\" for Democrats. \"It\\'s probably the first time that they actually realized this whole Russia thing was a hoax and the Ukraine thing is a hoax,\" Nunes contended. Schiff said he wants to talk with constituents and colleagues before making a final judgment on impeachment. Still, he argued that the evidence produced so far \"overwhelmingly shows serious misconduct by the president\". Congressional Republican support for Trump is showing no overt signs of buckling. Schiff said that if no Republicans ended up voting to support impeachment, he believes it would mean a failure of the GOP to put the country over their party. He contended that if President Barack Obama had acted like Trump on Ukraine, Republicans \"would have voted to impeach him in a heartbeat with a fraction of the evidence\". \"If this had been a Democratic president, I would be among those leading the way and saying, we need to seriously consider impeaching this president,\" Schiff asserted. Polling has shown that while public opinion has shifted recently toward slightly backing Trump\\'s impeachment, Democrats strongly support the effort while Republicans vehemently oppose it. Independents have been divided. If the Democratic-led House did vote to impeach Trump, the case would then move to the Senate where a trial would likely take place in early 2020. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he expects the House to vote to impeach. \"When it comes to the Senate, I do not think the allegations will be summarily dismissed,\" Kennedy said. He said he is in favor of letting all sides \"offer whatever in terms of evidence and bring whatever witnesses they want\". \"I don\\'t mind sitting there as long as it takes,\" Kennedy said. Associated Press staff writer Hope Yen contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday heard opposing viewpoints in the debate over youth vaping but offered no insight into where he would ultimately come down on the issue after promising two months ago that he would ban most flavored e-cigarettes but later backtracking. He said the administration would announce its plan \"very soon\". \"We want to take care of our kids, got to take care of our kids,\" Trump told reporters after listening to more than an hour of at times robust debate among representatives from the vaping industry, the nation\\'s major health associations, parent advocates and business groups. Trump backed off the proposal he announced in September after advisers told him a ban would not serve his political interests. In Friday\\'s meeting, he asked most of those seated around the table in the Cabinet Room to spell out their solution. Health groups told him they support the near-total ban on e-cigarette flavors that he promised in September. \"Our stance is very aligned with what you suggested on Sept. 11,\" said Gary M. Reedy, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, a position shared by the American Lung Association, said its president and CEO, Harold Wimmer. Others pressed for banning all flavors, including mint and menthol, arguing that teens will gravitate to those flavors if they remain on the market. Other participants argued for raising the age limit for legal purchases of electronic cigarettes from 18 to 21. Trump said earlier this month that the administration will pursue such an increase. He said Friday that age would be discussed at the meeting, calling it a \"big factor\". Federal law bans sales of e-cigarettes to those under 18, but some states have pushed that to 21 — the same as with traditional cigarettes. Industry representatives argued against banning sweet, fruity and other flavors that have proven attractive to teens, arguing that bans don\\'t work. Trump seemed sympathetic to that argument as he compared a flavor ban to prohibition and suggested that such a move could lead to the creation of a black market for flavored e-cigarettes. \"If you don\\'t give it to them, it\\'s going to come here illegally,\" Trump said. Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, told Trump that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, \"who is no friend to your presidency,\" is funding a $160 million campaign to try to ban these flavors. Conley said thousands of small business and mom-and-pop vape shops would go out of business if they are limited to just selling tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes, and that thousands of jobs would disappear from an economy Trump describes as booming. Bloomberg is considering entering the Democratic presidential race. Conley and others called instead for increasing the age limit to 21, limiting bulk sales of e-cigarettes and restricting their marketing. Juul Labs, the nation\\'s largest e-cigarette maker, stopped selling fruit and dessert flavors, like mango and cucumber, in stores last year. The company ended online sales of those flavors in October. Earlier this month, Juul dropped popular mint sales, leaving it to sell only menthol and tobacco flavors. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said during the meeting that kids are becoming addicted to nicotine because of the flavors. E-cigarettes typically heat a solution that contains nicotine, which makes cigarettes and e-cigarettes addictive. \"It\\'s a health emergency,\" said Romney, the co-sponsor of a bill with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., that would ban flavored e-cigarettes and subject them to cigarette taxes, among other measures designed to curb teen vaping. \"I salute the fact that Juul has said we\\'re taking these products off the market because we care about our kids,\" Romney said. Tony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, said by telephone after the meeting that he urged the administration to adopt its \"21 and Done\" proposal, which calls for increasing the age limit to 21 and adopting a series of marketing restrictions. Underage vaping has reached what health officials call epidemic levels. In the latest government survey, 1 in 4 high school students reported using e-cigarettes in the previous month. Trump had been expected to finalize a ban on most flavored e-cigarettes earlier this month, but backed off after advisers convinced him such a step could alienate voters who would be financially or otherwise affected by a vaping ban, according to two White House and Trump campaign officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the president\\'s private conversations.

What we\\'re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:. Days to Iowa caucuses: 70. Days to general election: 344. The presidential race comes to a an abrupt pause this week as voters and candidates alike shift their focus to food, football and family. The bar will be high for any new narrative to emerge over the Thanksgiving holiday, which means the Democratic primary will be locked in a four-way muddle at the top as newly announced candidate Michael Bloomberg spends big to exploit questions about his rivals and to attack President Donald Trump. THE BIG QUESTIONS. Can anyone break through the food coma. With just 10 weeks until voting begins, very few candidates in the crowded Democratic race can afford another week without making progress in addressing their glaring liabilities. The same could be said for Trump, who\\'s facing the prospect of impeachment as his party struggles with a revolt from women and suburban voters. But there\\'s likely little the candidates can do on a holiday week that they haven\\'t already done to change the direction of the dinner table conversation. Can he buy love. The 2020 contest\\'s latest shiny object, but this has more than 30 billion reasons to be taken seriously on his first week out as a candidate. Bloomberg, whose worth is estimated at $30 billion to $50 billion, is dumping more than $30 million into a first-week advertising blitz that will almost certainly show up during your Thanksgiving football watching. The early investment has officially broken the record for the largest single-week ad buy in political history. If this kind of investment doesn\\'t move the needle for the New York billionaire, it\\'s fair to wonder if anything will. Room for another moderate at the table. For all the candidates who need to do well in Iowa in just 70 days, we\\'re only aware of two who are having Thanksgiving dinner there. That would be Kamala Harris, who you\\'ll remember said she was \"moving to Iowa,\" and Amy Klobuchar, who serves neighboring Minnesota in the Senate but has struggled to persuade primary voters to embrace her Midwestern pragmatism. Klobuchar is scheduled to have Thanksgiving dinner with staff at the home of a former state party chairwoman, while Harris will cheer runners at a Des Moines turkey trot and spend time with seniors. Can Pete Buttigieg take the next step. He has proven he belongs in the top tier after another strong debate performance and rising poll numbers on the ground in Iowa. But the 37-year-old small-city mayor has virtually no path to the nomination unless he dramatically improves his standing with black voters. He opens the week back in Iowa, where he\\'s betting everything that a strong showing in the opening primary contest will convince skeptical minority voters that he\\'s electable. It\\'s a tough road, but absent a dominant front-runner he must be taken seriously. THE FINAL THOUGHT. Ten weeks before voting begins, the Democratic primary is truly wide open. There are four candidates clumped together in the top tier, and a candidate with essentially an unlimited budget just entered the race. 2020 Watch runs every Monday and provides a look at the week ahead in the 2020 election.

The wires snap in blizzards and hurricanes, causing dayslong outages. Everywhere, power poles topple in all kinds of disasters, blocking escape routes. Around the U.S., dealing with the vulnerability of overhead power lines — one of many problems that experts say will only get worse as the climate deteriorates — by burying them or strengthening them is spotty and disorganized on a national level, and painfully slow, at best. Utilities say there\\'s no one best way to safeguard the millions of miles of U.S. power lines and that doing so would cost many billions of dollars — $3 million for a single mile of power lines by some estimates. Critics counter by pointing to the at least equally great economic costs of outages and utility-sparked wildfires. Estimated property losses for a single such wildfire, a California blaze that killed 85 last year, reached $16.5 billion. Overall, electrical outages caused by bad weather cost the U.S. economy up to $33 billion in an average year — and more, in an especially bad weather year, the Energy Department estimated in 2013. The researchers estimated there were 679 widespread outages from harsh weather between 2003 and 2012. After electrical wires sparked many of California\\'s major wildfires in 2017 and 2018, and threatened more this autumn, many there turned their fear and anger on PG&E, the state\\'s largest investor-owned utility. Vicki McCaslin, a 60-year-old repeat evacuee in the San Francisco Bay area, described spotting a PG&E worker in her neighborhood during a lull in last month\\'s wind and fires. McCaslin burst into tears as she begged the utility worker to cut off power to her area before the winds and wildfires resumed, she recounted. \"It scares me to death to think of those kinds of winds with our power on\". Nationally, experts say, problems with 19th century-style set-ups of wires dangling from wooden poles will only grow as climate change increases the severity and frequency of hurricanes, wildfires, big snowstorms and other disasters like tornados. It\\'s a problem nationwide, not just in California. In coastal states such as Florida, hurricanes topple poles and knock out power for days. And in heartland states like Minnesota, it\\'s wintry ice storms and high winds that bring the electrical wires crashing down. Crucially, though, it\\'s not a nationally regulated problem. That means that across the country, involvement and funding from the federal government on burying and otherwise strengthening community electrical grids have been scattered and small-scale. That\\'s because it\\'s state and local officials, not federal ones, who hold most of the direct regulatory authority over local electrical infrastructure and local utility rates, said Ted Kury, director of energy studies for the University of Florida\\'s Public Utility Research Center. Federal regulators\\' role is largely limited to overseeing high-voltage transmission lines that cross state borders. Nationally, a 2012 study estimated one-fourth of new power lines are buried. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s hazard-mitigation program has handed out $176 million for 156 projects to bury power lines, in 16 states and four U.S. territories, FEMA says. Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation this year to encourage moving power lines underground, has been one of the top recipients, along with Minnesota. But the FEMA hazard-mitigation grants for the work so far break down to a little more than $1 million per project. In California, where PG&E oversees 100,000 miles of overhead electrical lines, that average size of grant doesn\\'t cover the price tag PG&E puts on burying a single mile of line. That mostly leaves households with the bill for doing any burying of power lines, mostly through increased electrical rates. In practice, that means more affluent communities with the means to pay higher rates are sometimes the ones getting their lines buried, in decisions driven as much by looks as by safety and convenience. In Palm Beach, Florida, a resort community of first, second and third homes, property owners paid attention when a utility begin to erect unlovely concrete power poles as part of an effort to harden the state\\'s electrical grid against hurricanes. Instead of accepting the concrete poles, Palm Beach\\'s residents narrowly voted in 2017 to pay for a $90 million bond issue, paid for by property owners, to bury the overhead lines. \"There\\'s big benefits,\" said Steven Stern, manager of Palm Beach\\'s undergrounding utilities program, who noted hurricanes sometimes knocked out power for days. And \"the look is fantastic\". In some places, burying the electrical lines is all but physically impossible, utilities and others argue. In parts of California\\'s Sierra Nevada and other ranges, for instance, that would entail excavating into granite. In Florida, Mike Hyland, senior vice president of the American Public Power Association for community-owned utilities, has seen utilities try and fail to bury cable in the unstable sand. Utility companies argue that in some parts of the country, burying power lines would make problems worse, especially as storms and sea rise worsen with climate change. Hyland points to Superstorm Sandy in 2012, when a nearly 14-foot tidal surge flooded underground electrical networks even as the storm toppled above-ground lines, depriving more than 8 million people of power. For electric utilities looking at how to harden their networks against the varied climate change potpourri of sea rise, heavy rains, wind, drought and wildfires, \"it\\'s all these scenarios coming at you,\" Hyland said. \"Plus at the end of the day you\\'ve got a squirrel jumping on your lines\". In California, state leaders and ordinary people increasingly accuse PG&E of negligence for not moving faster to safeguard power lines serving more than 5 million homes and businesses. California\\'s worst wildfire seasons on record, in terms of property damage and deaths, were in 2017 and 2018. State fire investigators found sparks from PG&E electrical equipment responsible for many of the fires. That includes the state\\'s deadliest fire ever, a wildfire — started by PG&E power lines — that killed 85 people and all but wiped out the northern California town of Paradise. State investigations in recent years concluded the utility put a priority on financial performance, including diverting millions of dollars intended for safety upgrades to shareholders and to bonuses for company executives. The state is requiring PG&E to make $5 billion in safety improvements, said Ann Patterson, one of the members of a team appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to safeguard residents from the electrical network. Burying power lines is \"one tool in the toolbox\" to that end, Patterson said. PG&E spokeswoman Jennifer Robison says the utility has spent $15 billion on its electrical network over the last five years and will have buried or otherwise hardened 150 miles of power lines in 2019 by the end of the year. PG&E proposes to cover, strengthen or bury 7,100 miles of overhead lines in the next decade, Robison said. That\\'s less than one-10th of the utility\\'s existing overhead lines, however. In the meantime, PG&E this year stepped up a controversial program of intentional cut-offs during times of high winds. Two months of widespread, repeat outages — one of which affected 2.5 million people — plunged countless into darkness and ignited criticism from lawmakers.

American-led forces and their Syrian Kurdish allies have carried out their biggest joint operation against the Islamic State in Syria since President Donald Trump ordered a pullback of U.S. forces there. The U.S.-led coalition said Saturday that hundreds of U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish forces took part in Friday\\'s action. Coalition officials say the operation captured dozens of militants. The news comes on the same day Vice President Mike Pence visited Iraq and worked to reassure America\\'s Kurdish allies in the region. The Trump-ordered pullback of American forces in Syria opened the door for a cross-border offensive by Turkey last month, leaving Syrian Kurds to face a bloody Turkish assault. Pence says the U.S. commitment to both Syrian and Iraqi Kurds remains unchanged. The U.S. wants Iraq to show restraint as widespread anti-corruption protests in the country have killed more than 320 people in the past two months. Vice President Mike Pence spoke by phone to Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi from Al-Asad Air Base on an unannounced trip to the region. Pence expressed support for a free, sovereign and independent Iraq — a subtle warning against Iranian influence in the country, which has weakened cooperation between the U.S. and Iraq. According to one official, Mahdi expressed regret for the violence and cast it as growing pains for the country and its security services, more used to war than democratic protest. Pence spoke by phone with Mahdi after the Iraqi leader declined an invitation to meet with Pence at the air base after security concerns prevented Pence from traveling into Baghdad. Vice President Mike Pence is criticizing Washington\\'s impeachment proceedings as he greets U.S. troops on a pre-Thanksgiving trip to Iraq. Speaking at Al-Asad Air Base, Pence said the Trump administration is working to secure another pay increase for the armed forces and suggested the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington was slowing the way. He says: \"Partisan politics and endless investigations have slowed things down in D.C\". Accompanied by his wife, Karen, Pence is serving Turkey and traditional fixings to hundreds of troops at the air base and another base in Erbil. Pence is praising service members, saying, \"While you come from the rest of us, you\\'re the best of us\". Vice President Mike Pence is making an unannounced visit to Iraq in the highest-level American trip since President Donald Trump ordered a pullback of U.S. forces in Syria two months ago. Pence is meeting Saturday with Iraqi Kurdistan President Nechirvan Barzani in a move meant to reassure the U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State after Syrian Kurds suffered under a bloody Turkish assault last month after the withdrawal. Pence is also visiting Iraq\\'s Al-Asad Air Base, from which U.S. forces launched the operation in Syria last month that resulted in the death of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Pence, joined by his wife, Karen, is also greeting U.S. troops ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Iraqi officials say Vice President Mike Pence has arrived in Iraq on an unannounced visit. The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, say Pence arrived at the Ain al-Asad air base in Anbar Province in western Iraq on Saturday. U.S. troops are based in the complex. The visit is Pence\\'s first to Iraq and comes nearly one year since President Donald Trump\\'s surprise visit to the country. It is not immediately known whether Pence will meet with Iraqi officials during his stay.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump\\'s latest reasons for firing Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine: She was an \"Obama person\" who refused to hang Trump\\'s portrait in the U.S. Embassy. That\\'s false on both counts. Trump\\'s pique about not having his picture displayed in a timely way — actually the fault of his administration, not the ambassador — came during a week of unfounded or distorted statements by the president about the impeachment inquiry and the political favor he sought from Ukraine. A look at recent claims, as well as from Democratic presidential contenders in their latest debate:. TRUMP: \"This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful, she wouldn\\'t hang my picture in the embassy. She\\'s in charge of the embassy. She wouldn\\'t hang it. It took like a year and a half or two years for her to get the picture up\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: She\\'s not the reason why Trump\\'s photo wasn\\'t displayed in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine after his inauguration. Trump\\'s official portrait for display in federal facilities was not released by the White House until October 2017. Portraits for U.S. embassies came months after that. Lewis Lukens, former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in London, tweeted Friday: \"I was in charge of the US embassy in London for much of Trump\\'s first year. We didn\\'t hang his picture either. It took the WH almost 15 months to get official photos sent to embassies to hang. And we were instructed not to print other photos\". The former ambassador to Georgia, Ian Kelly, tweeted: \"Our official White House portraits did not arrive at Embassy Tbilisi until March 2018. This was because the WH was late getting them to all embassies\". Yovanovitch\\'s attorney, Larry Robbins, told The Associated Press that the embassy in Kyiv hung Trump\\'s official portrait, along with Vice President Mike Pence\\'s and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\'s, \"as soon as they arrived from Washington, DC\". Trump previously accused Yovanovitch of leaving countries in disarray \"everywhere\" she went as a diplomat, wholly misrepresenting her record. In any event, a president doesn\\'t need to give a reason for firing an ambassador. TRUMP: \"This was an Obama person\". — Fox interview. THE FACTS: No, she is a nonpartisan civil servant who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations as a 33-year State Department employee. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and then Armenia by Republican President George W. Bush. Then she was named to the Ukraine ambassadorship by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2016. Trump dismissed her from that post in May. TRUMP: \"Why isn\\'t Germany, France, the European Union, why aren\\'t all those countries in Europe, why aren\\'t they paying? Why is it always the United States the sucker? I got elected on that\". — Fox interview Friday. THE FACTS: He\\'s incorrect that the U.S. is \"always\" the one putting up Ukraine aid. European Union institutions have provided far more development assistance than the $204 million from Washington. Specific EU members, Japan and Canada also contribute significantly. Since 2014, the EU and European financial institutions have mobilized more than $16 billion to help Ukraine\\'s economy, counter corruption, build institutions and strengthen its sovereignty against further incursions by Russia after its annexation of Crimea. The U.S. is a heavy source of military assistance. The aid package held back by Trump as he pressed Ukraine to investigate Democrats was worth nearly $400 million. But NATO also contributes a variety of military-assistance programs and trust funds for Ukraine. In most such cases, the programs are modest and NATO countries other than the U.S. take the lead. TRUMP: \"Why should we give money to a country that\\'s known corrupt?\" — Fox News interview Friday. REP. DEVIN NUNES of California, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee: Trump has good reason to be wary \"of widespread corruption in that country\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s defense that he withheld aid to Ukraine due to corruption concerns is shaky. Two weeks of hearings produced bountiful testimony that Trump was singularly focused on getting Ukraine to open investigations into Democrats. In his first phone call with Ukraine\\'s new leader, in April, the White House said at the time that Trump discussed his interest in having Ukraine rein in widespread corruption. But in the recently released rough transcript of the call, he actually did not mention corruption at all. Trump had $391 million in congressionally approved U.S. assistance withheld from Ukraine from July to September. The Defense Department had already certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the military assistance. Before the July hold on the aid, the Trump administration had approved sending aid to Ukraine nearly 50 times without holding it because of corruption concerns. Witnesses testified that Trump did not articulate concerns about Ukraine corruption other than expressing interest into investigations that would benefit him politically. In his July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as they discussed military aid, \"I would like for you to do us a favor, though\" and investigate Joe Biden, his son and Democrats going back to the 2016 U.S. election, based on a discredited theory involving purported Ukrainian interference in the election. Trump ultimately released the aid, on Sept. 11, after Congress became aware of what he had done. A few days earlier, congressional committees had begun looking into the matter, aware that a whistleblower had a complaint in motion. TRUMP, referring to Democrats: \"The FBI went in and they told them, get out of here, you\\'re not getting — we\\'re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it\\'s called, which is a country — which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That\\'s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company? Why?\" — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s statement is false in multiple ways. CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company — it is based in Sunnyvale, California. It is not owned by a Ukrainian, but rather an American who emigrated to the U.S. as a child — from Russia, not Ukraine. The cybersecurity firm made the original determination that Russia was responsible for the 2016 hack of Democratic emails that were subsequently disclosed by WikiLeaks. The company counts among its clients the National Republican Congressional Committee, for which it investigated email thefts by unidentified hackers during the 2018 campaign. When Trump says the \"FBI has never gotten that server,\" he is referring to the fact that the FBI did not receive physical servers from the Democratic National Committee after its emails were hacked in the 2016 campaign. Instead, the FBI relied on detailed forensics provided by CrowdStrike. The FBI confirmed those findings. Using that evidence, special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s team charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with the hack. Still, Trump persists not only in misidentifying the nationality of the owner and what country the firm is from, but in advancing the notion that Ukrainians hacked the DNC and made it look as if Russians did it. TRUMP: \"A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right, from the DNC, Democratic National Committee, you know. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump is shrugging off not only the week\\'s testimony of current and former aides at the hearing, but advice going back months from officials who told him such assertions are invalid. None of the witnesses who testified at the hearings — including those the Republicans wanted to hear from — gave credence to Trump\\'s theory that Ukraine attacked the U.S. election and tried to make Russia look like the villain. Several testified to the contrary, that there is no evidence of Ukraine interference. Even before his July phone call pressing Ukraine\\'s president to investigate the theory, his own staff repeatedly told him it was \"completely debunked,\" Trump\\'s first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said in September. \"Fictions,\" a former senior director on the National Security Council for Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, testified Thursday. She told committee members: \"I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests\". TRUMP: \"I hardly know him, OK?\" — Fox interview Friday. TRUMP: \"I don\\'t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy, though. But I don\\'t know him well\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: That\\'s not credible. Testimony by several officials revealed that Sondland, Trump\\'s EU ambassador, was in frequent contact with Trump around the time Trump spoke with Zelenskiy about doing a politically beneficial \"favor\". Tim Morrison, the former NSC Russia and Europe senior director, who took over from Hill in July, told House investigators that Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released as Trump pressed for the favor. Morrison said the ambassador \"related to me he was acting — he was discussing these matters with the president\". Sondland himself changed his testimony Wednesday to acknowledge more contacts with Trump than previously revealed. As recently as Oct. 8, Trump had tweeted that Sondland was a \"really good man and great American\". Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\\'s inaugural committee before being named the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. But Trump quickly became less familiar with his ambassador when Sondland testified that the president wanted a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats as a condition for his releasing U.S. military aid to that country. TRUMP: \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn\\'t care about American Workers!\" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Neither happened. Trump visited a factory in Austin, Texas, that has made the Mac Pro for Apple since 2013. Apple announced in September that it would continue having the Mac Pro line made in Austin, after the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on certain computer parts from China. It also plans to expand its already deeply rooted business in Austin and said Wednesday it has started construction of its new campus in the city. None of that equates to Trump\\'s false claim to have opened an Apple plant Wednesday. Meantime, the House worked into Wednesday evening, after Trump\\'s false tweet that Pelosi had shut Congress, and again Thursday before breaking for Thanksgiving week. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, Democratic chairman of the intelligence committee: \"I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression, listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing, that Russia didn\\'t intervene in our election. It was all the Ukrainians\". — hearing Thursday. HILL: \"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves\". — hearing Thursday. REP. ELISE STEFANIK, Republican of New York: \"Not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections. To have our Democratic colleagues say these untruthful statements just reeks of political desperation\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Stefanik may be right that Republicans on the committee did not explicitly deny that Russia attacked the U.S. election. Yet Schiff and Hill may also be right in saying that Republicans left that impression at the hearings. Some Republicans on the committee repeatedly gave credence to the conspiracy theory that holds that Ukrainians actually hacked the Democratic National Committee emails, perhaps with a server that was in their country, and made it look as if Russia did it. To buy into this theory is to discount Russian culpability. A 2018 report by the then-Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election, but disagreed with parts of the agencies\\' assessment that said Russia did so to help Trump. TRUMP: \"Right now you have a kangaroo court headed by little shifty Schiff, where we don\\'t have lawyers, we don\\'t have witnesses, we don\\'t have anything\". — Cabinet meeting Tuesday. THE FACTS: Depends on the meaning of \"we\". Republicans on the committee had a lawyer asking questions of the witnesses, so it\\'s not true that they had no legal representation. And several witnesses were invited at the request of Republicans on the committee. It\\'s also true, though, that Trump himself did not have a lawyer speaking for him at the hearings. That\\'s not unusual. The inquiry is meant to be a fact-finding process and the president is not charged with anything. He will have legal representation if the House Judiciary Committee moves ahead to draft articles of impeachment against him. BERNIE SANDERS: \"What the scientists are telling us is if we don\\'t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we\\'re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we\\'re talking about increased drought, we\\'re talking about increased extreme weather disturbances\". — Democratic debate Wednesday. THE FACTS: To be clear, the world\\'s big cities aren\\'t going to go underwater for good in as soon as eight to nine years. The Vermont senator\\'s reference to eight to nine years seems to refer to standard warnings of the expected temperature increases kicking in by roughly 2030, and the progressively worse weather extremes that will keep following. JOE BIDEN: \"The fact is the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: The former vice president\\'s statement is at odds with a Kaiser Family Foundation poll out this week. It found that 77% of Democrats support Medicare for All. Even more — 88% — support a \"public option\" proposal such as the one Biden advocates. It would allow people to buy into a new government insurance plan modeled on Medicare, but it would not completely replace private insurance. Overall, 53% of Americans support Medicare for All, while 43% oppose it, according to the Kaiser poll. It\\'s also true, though, that public support for Medicare for All declines when costs and other, similar details are introduced in the polling. ELIZABETH WARREN: \"Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, (of) whites who borrowed money, 94% have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African Americans have paid it off\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That\\'s not right. The Massachusetts senator appears to be citing a September report from Brandeis University\\'s Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The study found that, 20 years after starting college, 49% of white borrowers had paid off their loans entirely (not 94% of them) compared with 26% of black borrowers (not 5%). The study also found that the typical white student had paid off 94% of his or her debt, while the typical black borrower had only paid off 5%. Warren cited those statistics, but in the wrong way. She\\'s correct that there are disparities by race when it comes to paying back student loans. Other studies have similarly found that black borrowers are at greater risk of default than their white counterparts. TULSI GABBARD: \"The most recent example of inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels\". — Democratic debate. PETE BUTTIGIEG: \"That is outlandish, even by the standards of today\\'s politics. I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We\\'ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\" — Democratic debate. GABBARD: \"You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: Neither offered a fully accurate account in their exchange. Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman, did not accuse Buttigieg of being open to \"invading\" Mexico, as he suggested she did. But she did not explain the context of Buttigieg\\'s remarks at a Latino-issues forum in Los Angeles last Sunday. At the forum, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, heavily conditioned the idea of sending troops to help Mexico fight the drug and gang war, saying he would only do so if Mexico wanted the assistance as part of a security partnership. \"There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,\" Buttigieg said in Los Angeles. \"I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this were necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations. \"But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role if and only if it is welcome by our partner south of the border\".

Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck.WASHINGTON (AP) — On the night before Joe Biden\\'s world collapsed, he sat in a picture-perfect scene with his wife by the fireside in their Delaware living room. Biden, the hotshot senator-elect at just 30, was reflecting on the big things he would do when he got to Washington. It was one week out from Christmas in 1972, and Neilia, also 30, was addressing holiday cards as her husband rambled on. But then she interrupted his musings to share an ill premonition. \"What\\'s going to happen, Joey?\" she asked her husband, in Biden\\'s later recounting. \"Things are too good\". One day later, Neilia and the couple\\'s 13-month old daughter, Naomi, were dead. Sons Hunter and Beau, a year and a day apart at 3 and 4, were seriously injured. While Biden was in Washington setting up his new office, Neilia\\'s car had been broadsided by a tractor-trailer as she took the kids to pick out a Christmas tree. When the phone rang, Biden said later, \"I knew\". \"You just felt it in your bones\". Nothing would ever be the same. Biden was instantly transformed into a politician whose career would forever be grounded in tragedy. Loss became central to Biden\\'s political persona, a history he has often shared — at some points reluctantly, at others readily and on at least a few occasions with inaccuracies in the account. Now in his third bid for the White House, the painful story comes up as point of connection to voters and a personal experience on health care policy. But Biden confidants say the history is much more than that. It\\'s essential to explaining the candidate\\'s inclination to give others, even political opponents, the benefit of the doubt. Surmounting loss helped to shape a determination to overcome hard things that friends see reflected in Biden\\'s recent talk about the need to work even with those \"who may offend every fiber of your being,\" and in his can-do attitude toward world trouble spots. As it turned out, Biden\\'s passage through hardship was not to be a one-time journey but a well-traveled path. His life was later rocked by serious illness, political setbacks, and, in 2015, Beau\\'s death from brain cancer at age 46. There were other, less public, trials, including Hunter\\'s struggles as an adult with addiction. Despite life\\'s cruelties, though, Biden remarried, added daughter Ashley to his family, spent 26 years in the Senate, eight as vice president and pursued the presidency off and on for more than three decades. He\\'s now making another run at age 76. \"He is the unluckiest person I\\'ve ever known personally, and he is the luckiest person I\\'ve ever known personally,\" says longtime friend Ted Kaufman, who succeeded Biden in the Senate. After the accident, Biden had no interest in the Senate anymore. No ambition for anything, really. His world view shrank to taking care of his boys. \"For the first time in my life, I understood how someone could consciously decide to commit suicide,\" he would later reveal. Biden didn\\'t just have to deal with grief. He had the added burden of processing it in public. On Dec. 19, 1972, the day after Neilia\\'s car accident, Richard Nixon\\'s aides briefed the president on the tragedy, spelling out the name of the unfamiliar incoming senator \"B-I-D-E-N\". Then the White House operator patches Biden through for a condolence call. \"So uh, so the, uh, but, uh, in any event, uh, I mean, looking at it in a, as you must, in terms of the future, because you, you have the great fortune of being young,\" the president tells him. \"And now I\\'m sure that, uh, she\\'ll be watching you from now on\". Biden utters a hurried thank you and ends the call. He debated relinquishing the Senate seat he\\'d yet to even occupy but eventually agreed to give the job a try for six months. Two-and-half weeks after Neilia\\'s death, Biden was sworn in as senator in a small chapel at the hospital in Delaware. Beau, still in traction, was wheeled into the room in his bed; Hunter, by then out of the hospital, perched on his brother\\'s bed for the ceremony. Senators gave Biden broad leeway once in office. His sister Valerie moved in to take care of the boys. The new senator went home to Delaware every night to kiss them good night. For decades to come, Biden would wrestle with the image he cut as a tragic figure and a self-described \"hot commodity\" on the Washington scene. Loss became part of the Biden package. And it made for an uncomfortable fit at times. \"I am the youngest man in the Senate and I am also the victim of a tragic fate which makes me very newsworthy,\" he told Washingtonian in a 1974 interview. \"I\\'m sure that\\'s why I get so many invitations all the time. I don\\'t accept them and people understand why\". The conversation revealed a man still struggling with how to be in the spotlight. He at times appears boastful and also still broken. Biden shared a photo of his deceased wife in a bikini, offering that she looked \"better than a Playboy bunny\" and calling her \"my greatest ally, my sensuous lover\". He mentioned getting Rose Kennedy dinner invitations \"at least 10 times and I\\'ve only gone once\". Former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who served with Biden in the Senate for nearly two decades, says that while many a politician wrestles with hidden personal tragedies, Biden from the beginning has been open about his pain. When people \"see someone who is able to make his way through that in public, which is infinitely more difficult, they have a feeling for him as a human being,\" Bradley said. \"Joe is Joe,\" says Bradley. \"There\\'s no artifice\". When Sen. Chris Coons\\' father lay dying in hospice care, there were plenty of expressions of support and concern. The comforting words that the Delaware Democrat heard from Biden, a longtime friend, were different. \"He knows what you\\'re going through,\" says Coons. \"He knows that you can come through it\". He\\'s seen Biden do the same for countless others — the family of a lost firefighter, the parent of a son killed in Afghanistan, the widow of local restaurateur, and so many more. Often, these strangers-turned-partners-in-grief hear a message of reassurance from Biden that\\'s drawn from his own experience: There will come a day, I promise you, when the thought of your son or daughter or your husband or wife \"brings a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye\". They also may come away with his cellphone number. \"I have a long list of strangers who have my private number and an invitation to call,\" Biden wrote in his 2017 book. \"And many of them do\". Former Democratic Rep. Steve Israel of New York says Biden called his mother in 2011 when the vice president heard that her husband had been diagnosed with lung cancer. In 2013, five months after Israel\\'s father died, the congressman\\'s mother told him, \"Joe called\". Israel assumed she was reminiscing about Biden\\'s call in 2011. \"No,\" his mother told him. \"He just called a few days ago to check in on me\". He called on New Year\\'s Day, because the start of a new year is hard without someone you love. \"For many politicians, empathy is a strategy,\" Israel said. \"For Joe Biden, it\\'s second nature\". Iowa state Sen. Pam Jochum, a Democrat, remembers Biden calling to comfort her after her daughter Sarah died, and then again after he got wind that her sister had died just six months later. \"Good lord, woman, you\\'ve been through the wringer,\" she remembers Biden telling her. \"The man understands the joys and sorrows of life,\" Jochum said. \"I think it informs his public decisions\". For one family, though, the famed Biden reputation for empathy comes up short. Curtis Dunn was the driver whose truck struck Neilia\\'s car. By all accounts, Dunn was absolved of wrongdoing in the accident, with no evidence that speeding or alcohol was a factor. Dunn, who died in 1999, never forgot that awful day, wondering aloud in future years \"how the little Biden boys are doing,\" recalls his daughter, 54-year-old Pamela Hamill of Newark, Delaware. But decades later, Biden on at least two occasions, in 2001 and 2007, offered an inaccurate version of Dunn\\'s role in the accident, referring publicly to a truck driver who \"stopped to drink\" before driving and describing the driver as \"a guy who allegedly — and I never pursued it — drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch\". Hamill, dismayed by the misrepresentations, crusaded to correct the record, and got some media attention for her efforts. Biden later called her — at first agitated about the impact the controversy was having on his own mother, who he said \"had to go on anxiety medication,\" in Hamill\\'s recounting. Further, Biden told her it was his own son, Beau, who had had to retrieve the accident report. \"Then he was very apologetic,\" Hamill continued. \"By this time I was in tears. He said, \\'I\\'m sorry, don\\'t cry. I will come to your home with all your family there and apologize.\\'\" But Biden told her he would not issue a public apology, telling Hamill that it would \"end up in all the trashy magazines in the grocery store\". Hamill never took him up on the offer to meet with her family, worried about how her mother would handle it. She never heard from him again. \"I wish he would have done it publicly, but I put it to rest after that,\" Hamill said. His refusal to make a public apology, she said, \"is very telling\". In his latest pursuit of the presidency, his third try, Biden has often been reluctant to express regret. He\\'s caught flak from his Democratic rivals for his friendly relationships with political rivals. For calling Vice President Mike Pence \"a decent man\". For pointing with pride to his ability to deal with \"civility\" with segregationists such as Democratic Sens. James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia long ago in order to get things done. In both instances, Biden went on to stress that he had had sharp policy differences with his former colleagues. After resisting for a time, Biden eventually apologized for giving the \"impression\" that he was praising segregationists but still defended his strategy of working \"even with those we find repugnant\" to accomplish things. What struck detractors as a jarring disconnect made perfect sense to Biden fans, who trace a direct line from his background of suffering to his inclination toward connection. \"It\\'s why he said Mike Pence is a good man,\" says former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who spent a dozen years in the Senate with Biden. \"That\\'s how he sees humans\". Some see a connection, too, between Biden\\'s past trials and the confident way he approaches national challenges. When Biden played down China\\'s threat to the U.S. — \"China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man\" — he drew criticism from some of his Democratic rivals and President Donald Trump for underestimating the geopolitical challenge. But Coons saw it as a reflection of Biden\\'s belief in the power of individuals — and nations — to overcome great hurdles. \"What he was saying then is what he was saying to me and to so many others,\" says Coons, recalling Biden\\'s words of comforts when his father was dying. \"This is really hard but you can do it and you can get through it\". Nearly half a century into his political career, Biden still processes events through the frame of reference of his past travails. And he\\'s still prone to mentioning the tragedies of his life as political lessons. Often, he brings up the twin tragedies of his wife and daughter\\'s deaths and then Beau\\'s death in the context of health care policy, saying he \"couldn\\'t imagine\" what it would be like if he hadn\\'t had good access to health care. He mentioned the accident during a speech to a firefighters union in March, six weeks before he announced his latest campaign. \"I\\'m going to repeat myself but we feel so deeply indebted,\" he said. \"In December of \\'72 when my wife was bringing home a Christmas tree, a tractor-trailer broadsided, killed my wife, killed my daughter. It took about an hour and a half, I\\'m told, for the jaws of life from my fire company to save my boys who in all likelihood, I\\'m told, would have died as well\". He choked up last month during a speech in Iowa in which he invoked both the deaths of Beau and of his wife and daughter as he praised personal caregivers who are there to hold people\\'s hands when they \"get really scared\". In this, Biden is hardly alone. Many politicians use personal episodes to make political point. Still, it was somewhat unexpected to hear him invoke his history as he defended himself against criticism that he was too physical with women. He tries to \"make a human connection\" with those trying to \"get through tragedy,\" Biden said in a video message in which he said he understood that the boundaries of personal space have been reset in recent years. \"Over the years, knowing what I\\'ve been through, the things I\\'ve faced, I\\'ve found that scores, if not hundreds of people have come up to me and reached out for solace and comfort\". Soon after, Biden went on to crack jokes about the criticism, suggesting it was an overreaction of the #Metoo era. When it came time for Biden to make the decision on whether to run for president in the 2016 election, his emotions over the death of Beau were still too raw. In an interview on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on Sept. 11, 2015, three months after Beau\\'s death, Biden opened up about his fragile state. He recalled a recent visit he had made to a military base in Colorado that had been going great until a man in the crowd called out Beau\\'s name and said they had served together in Iraq. \"All of a sudden I lost it,\" Biden said. \"I shouldn\\'t be saying this, but you can\\'t do that. You can\\'t do that\". Still, Biden kept open his political options well into that October — and seethed when critics suggested he had leaked talk about Beau\\'s desire for him to run as part of a crass political calculation. \"The idea that I would use my son\\'s death to political advantage was sickening,\" Biden wrote in his book about Beau\\'s passing, \"Promise Me, Dad\". \"I didn\\'t think anybody would believe the charge, but I could feel my anger rise\". On Oct. 21, 2015, at age 72, Biden announced he wouldn\\'t run for president — not in that election anyway. The assumption by many was that it was the end of the road for Biden\\'s political career. But less than four years later, the memory of Beau\\'s determination that his father stay engaged in public life factored into Biden\\'s decision to make another run. Whatever happens from here, there\\'s a kind of liberation for Biden in knowing that he can run and lose and it still won\\'t be the worst thing that\\'s happened to him. Kaufman, Biden\\'s longtime friend and political ally, says the two of them have a \"difference of opinion\" over how to age, Kaufman arguing that their older years should be a time to take a \"more contemplative\" approach to life. A few years back, Kaufman says, he sent Biden a quotation he\\'d found from Pope John XXIII from his days as a cardinal essentially validating Kaufman\\'s side of their running debate. Biden sent it back, after adding a counter message from poet Dylan Thomas:. \"Do not go gentle into that night,. Old age should burn and rave at close of day;. Rage, rage against the dying of the light\". Associated Press news researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report. Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at http://twitter.com/nbenac.

Flying in a C-17 military cargo aircraft, Pence landed in Irbil, capital of Iraq\\'s semiautonomous Kurdish region, to meet with Iraqi Kurdistan President Nechirvan Barzani. The visit was meant to hearten the United States\\' regional partners in the fight against the Islamic State group after the U.S. pulled troops from northern Syria, leaving America\\'s Kurdish allies there to face a bloody cross-border Turkish assault last month. Asked by reporters if the United States was facing a sense of betrayal from Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish allies over Trump\\'s actions in Syria, Pence said both groups, including Syrian Kurdish forces \"who fought alongside us,\" had no doubts about the U.S. commitment to them. \"It\\'s unchanging,\" Pence said. Earlier, Pence received a classified briefing at Iraq\\'s Al-Asad Air Base, from which U.S. forces are believed to have launched the operation in Syria last month that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Pence also spoke by phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. Underscoring Pence\\'s message that American military partnership with Syrian Kurdish forces is ongoing, the U.S.-led coalition said Saturday that its forces, along with hundreds of Syrian Kurdish commandos, had jointly carried out the largest operation against the Islamic State in eastern Syria since the U.S. pullback began in early October. Friday\\'s operation in southeastern Syria\\'s Deir el-Zour province captured dozens of Islamic State militants, cleared enemy compounds and seized weapons and explosives, the U.S.-led coalition said. Operations against Islamic State militants in Syria had been disrupted, but not totally halted, because of the U.S. troop pullback and Turkey\\'s invasion. Pence\\'s trip Saturday was his second to the region in five weeks. Trump deployed him on a whirlwind journey to Ankara, Turkey, last month to negotiate a cease-fire after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seized on the U.S. withdrawal to launch the offensive on U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. Trump\\'s move had sparked some of the most unified criticism of his administration to date, as lawmakers in both parties accused Trump of forsaking longtime Kurdish allies and inviting Russia and Iran to hold even greater sway in the volatile region. When the U.S. forces withdrew, Syria\\'s Kurds — seeking protection from their No. 1 enemy, Turkey — invited Syrian government and Russian forces into parts of northeastern Syria where they had not set foot in years. More are now deploying along large parts of the border region under a Russian-Turkish deal, including to at least one former U.S. garrison in northern Syria. The Ankara agreement required Syrian Kurds to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border in an arrangement that largely solidified Turkey\\'s position and aims. Pence hailed the cease-fire as the way to end the bloodshed caused by Turkey\\'s invasion. But Syrian-led Kurdish forces say the cease-fire is persistently violated. Fighting raged Saturday between them and Turkey-backed forces outside the Syrian town of Ein Issa, once home to U.S. bases and the Kurdish administration. A senior Syrian Kurdish official was critical Saturday of Washington\\'s lack of response to Turkey\\'s violations of the cease-fire. Limiting the U.S. partnership to military cooperation over a limited area with the Syrian Kurdish fighters, \"while condoning the killing of civilians, is not a very honest relationship and cooperation,\" the official, Ilham Ahmed, said. On Nov. 13, Trump feted Erdogan with a White House visit over the objection of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who argued Erdogan should be denied the honor of a West Wing visit in the aftermath of the invasion and because of his decision to purchase Russian-made surface-to-air missiles over the objection of NATO allies. In neighboring Syria, after declaring the near-complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, Trump decided that roughly 800 would stay to keep eastern Syria\\'s oil fields from falling back into the hands of the Islamic State. Trump also agreed to keep about 150 U.S. troops at a base in southern Syria as a check on Iranian influence in the region. While Trump has claimed that the U.S. was now \"keeping\" the oil in Syria, Pentagon officials indicated the U.S. presence is not intended to improve the oil infrastructure but to keep it in the hands of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Pence, joined on the trip by his wife, Karen Pence, also greeted U.S. troops ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, serving turkey and accompaniments to hundreds of troops at the two locations. \"While you come from the rest of us, you\\'re the best of us,\" Pence told service members in a dusty hangar at Al-Asad. He said the Trump administration is working to secure another pay increase for the armed services and suggested the ongoing impeachment inquiry in Washington was slowing the way. \"Partisan politics and endless investigations have slowed things down in D.C.,\" Pence said. Pence\\'s visit to Iraq comes as the country has been plagued by widespread anti-corruption protests. At least 320 protesters have been killed and thousands have been wounded since the unrest began on Oct. 1. Pence spoke by phone with Abdul-Mahdi after the Iraqi leader declined an invitation to meet with Pence at the air base when security concerns prevented Pence from traveling into Baghdad. Pence encouraged the Iraqi government to show restraint with the protesters. Associated Press writers Samya Kullab in Baghdad and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut contributed.WASHINGTON (AP) — Offering his own take on five long days of public hearings, President Donald Trump brushed off the impeachment inquiry as \"total nonsense\" on Friday and bad-mouthed a number of the U.S. diplomats who testified to Congress about his Ukraine pressure campaign. In one breath, Trump said House Democrats looked like \"fools\" during the hearings on Capitol Hill. In another, he offered a window into his political strategy ahead of an expected House vote to impeach him. If that happens, the Senate would hold a trial on whether to oust him from office. \"I think we had a tremendous week with the hoax,\" Trump said at the White House. At the same time, he talked up debunked conspiracy theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, speaking just one day after a former White House adviser testified that the claim was a \"fictional narrative\" that played into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also repeated claims that Obama administration officials spied on his campaign and underscored the need to keep Republicans unified against impeachment. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen support in the Republican party like we do right now,\" he said. In a 57-minute, animated phone interview on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump said he did not expect to be impeached. But he added that if the House did vote to impeach him, he would welcome a trial in the Republican-led Senate. \"Frankly, I want a trial,\" he said. A trial, he said, would give Republicans a chance to question Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the hearings as chairman of the House intelligence committee. Procedures for a Senate trial still are being worked out, but Republicans may well be hesitant to adopt Trump\\'s idea of turning a lawmaker into a witness. \"I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower, who is a fake whistleblower,\" the president said, adding that he knows the identity of the whistleblower whose formal complaint launched the impeachment inquiry. Trump\\'s professed confidence came after impeachment witnesses testified under oath that the president withheld aid from Ukraine to press the country to investigate his political rivals. Trump insisted he was trying to root out corruption in the Eastern European nation when he held up nearly $400 million in military aid to help Ukraine battle Russian aggression. \"I think it\\'s very hard to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing,\" Trump said. He denied there was any quid pro quo, extortion or bribery. He also denied holding up a White House meeting or military aid to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to launch investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son\\'s dealings in Ukraine. Uncowed by witnesses who warned against playing into the Russians\\' hands, Trump repeated a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainians might have hacked the Democratic National Committee\\'s network in 2016 and framed Russia for the crime. \"They gave the server to CrowdStrike, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian,\" Trump said. \"I still want to see that server. The FBI has never gotten that server\". Trump\\'s claim on Ukraine being behind the 2016 election interference has been discredited by intelligence agencies and his own advisers. CrowdStrike, an internet security firm based in California, investigated the DNC hack in June 2016 and traced it to two groups of hackers connected to a Russian intelligence service — not Ukraine. The company\\'s co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russian-born U.S. citizen who immigrated as a child and graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Fiona Hill, a former Russia adviser on the White House National Security Council, admonished Republicans in her testimony on Thursday for pushing unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,\" Hill said. Trump continued to distance himself from other impeachment witnesses, including Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Sondland said he was working on a deal to arrange a White House visit if Zelenskiy publicly announced investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. Democrat Joe Biden\\'s son Hunter was a Burisma board member. Speaking of Sondland, Trump said, \"I hardly know him, OK? I\\'ve spoken to him a few times\". The president said Sondland left out of his opening statement his account of a phone conversation in which Trump said: \"I want nothing. No quid pro quo. Have Zelenskiy do whatever is right\". Sondland \"didn\\'t put that in,\" Trump said. \"That was the end of him. I turned off the television\". He also denigrated the testimony of David Holmes, a counselor at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv. Holmes testified that he overheard a different phone conversation Sondland had with the president. Holmes said he heard the president talking loudly about Zelenskiy, asking, \"So, he\\'s gonna do the investigation?\" Ambassador Sondland replied that \"He\\'s gonna do it\". Trump said he didn\\'t believe Holmes could hear the conversation since it wasn\\'t on a speaker phone. \"That was a total phony deal,\" Trump said. And Trump continued to disparage former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. Trump recalled her from her post in Kyiv before her tenure was to end. Trump called her an \"Obama person\" and claimed she didn\\'t want his picture to hang on the wall of the embassy. Ian Kelly, the former U.S. ambassador to Georgia, tweeted in Yovanovitch\\'s defense, saying: \"Our official White House portraits did not arrive at Embassy Tbilisi until March 2018. This was because the WH (White House) was late getting them to all embassies\". Trump said he asked why some administration officials were being so kind to Yovanovitch. He claimed they told him, \"Well, sir, she\\'s a woman. We have to be nice\".WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is honoring the U.S. military dog that participated in the operation that ended with the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Trump says: \"So this is Conan. Right now, probably the world\\'s most famous dog,\" as he introduced Conan to the news media at the White House Rose Garden on Monday. Trump says he gave Conan a medal and a plaque. Trump has wanted to honor the Belgian Malinois since the late October raid on al-Baghdadi\\'s compound in northwest Syria. Conan was slightly injured in the operation but has since recovered and returned to active duty. After the operation, Trump posted an altered image on Twitter of him presenting Conan with a Medal of Honor. The image was captioned \"AMERICAN HERO\".WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is raising doubts about Alaska\\'s $500-a-year limit on contributions to political candidates. The justices are ordering a lower court to take a new look at the issue. The court says in an unsigned opinion Monday that federal judges who had rejected a challenge to the contribution cap did not take account of a 2006 high court ruling invalidating low-dollar limits on political contributions in Vermont. The Alaska challengers argue that the state is alone in imposing such low limits even on gubernatorial candidates \"who must campaign across Alaska\\'s vast expanse and widely dispersed media markets\". Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in a short separate opinion that Alaska\\'s reliance on the energy industry may make the state unusually vulnerable to political corruption and justify low limits.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Navy has been notified that the White House will not intervene to stop a disciplinary proceeding that could cost a SEAL his position in the elite unit, a senior Navy official said Sunday. Although President Donald Trump had tweeted on Thursday that he would not let the Navy remove Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher from the SEALs, the Navy was given White House guidance on Friday that it can proceed as planned, the Navy official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. This would seem to have defused a conflict between the president and Navy leaders, although it remained possible that Trump could still use his authority as commander in chief to intervene in the volatile and politically charged Gallagher case, despite assurances received by the Navy. Navy Secretary Richard Spencer said Saturday at an international security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, that he did not consider a tweet by Trump an order and would need a formal order to stop the Navy review board, scheduled to begin Dec. 2, that would determine whether Gallagher is allowed to remain in the SEALs. \"I need a formal order to act,\" Spencer said. Of Trump\\'s tweets, \"I don\\'t interpret them as a formal order\". Trump tweeted Thursday that the Navy \"will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher\\'s Trident Pin,\" inserting himself into the ongoing legal review of the sailor\\'s ability to hold onto the pin that designates him a SEAL. The Navy on Wednesday had notified Gallagher that he will face the review board to determine if he should remain on the elite force. Gallagher was acquitted of a murder charge in the stabbing death of an Islamic State militant captive, but a military jury convicted him of posing with the corpse while in Iraq in 2017. He was demoted from chief petty officer to a 1st class petty officer. Trump this month restored Gallagher\\'s rank. Spencer, speaking on the sidelines of the Halifax International Security Forum, said if the president requests the process to stop, the process stops. \"Good order and discipline is also obeying the orders of the president of the United States,\" he said. Despite the differing views with the president over the appropriate handling of the case, Spencer told reporters that he has not threatened to resign. But he acknowledged that he serves at the pleasure of the president. \"The president of the United States is the commander in chief. He\\'s involved in every aspect of government and he can make decisions and give orders as appropriate,\" he said. Gallagher\\'s lawyers have accused the Navy of trying to remove the SEAL designation in retaliation for Trump\\'s decision to restore his rank. Gallagher filed a complaint with the inspector general accusing Rear Adm. Collin Green, the Naval Special Warfare commander, of insubordination for defying Trump\\'s actions. Speaking Sunday on \"Fox & Friends,\" Gallagher repeated his argument that the Navy was acting in retaliation. \"They could have taken my Trident at any time they wanted,\" he said. \"Now they\\'re trying to take it after the president restored my rank\". Gallagher said he wanted to be allowed to retire on Nov. 30 \"with all the honors that I\\'ve earned, get back to my family\". Green also notified three SEAL officers who oversaw Gallagher during the deployment — Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil — that they are also being reviewed, according to U.S. officials. Removing their Trident pins means they will no longer be SEALs but could remain in the Navy. The Navy has revoked 154 Trident pins since 2011. This story has been corrected to say that Gallagher was demoted to 1st class petty officer.COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Aside a wall of 2-foot-tall letters spelling out \"Black Women Lead,\" behind a podium bearing a \"Black Women for Kamala\" sign, Kamala Harris made an appeal Saturday to black women in South Carolina, a contingency whose support she sees as crucial to the viability of her presidential candidacy. \"When we talk about black girl magic, we know that it is something special,\" Harris told the crowd of about 300, most of whom were black women, in a ballroom at Benedict College, a historically black institution in downtown Columbia. \"But that magic is born out of hard work. It didn\\'t just magically appear. We worked hard for that\". Part of a \"Black Women\\'s Weekend of Action,\" the California senator\\'s campaign framed the event as one to focus on issues important to black women, like pay equity and maternal health. Emceed by actress Sheryl Lee Ralph, the round table discussion also featured U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, a Congressional Black Caucus member who is backing Harris. It also included Glynda Carr, whose Higher Heights organization officially endorsed Harris earlier this month. The country\\'s largest online political organization aimed at electing black women, Higher Heights provided significant support during the 2018 midterms to candidates who helped usher in the most diverse Congress in history. To a roomful of affirmations and applause, Carr noted that black women \"don\\'t vote alone,\" hitting directly on the girl-power style Harris is aiming to harness this weekend in South Carolina, with female-focused, civic engagement that stands in contrast to some less personalized stops in the campaign. Saturday began with phone banking and voter canvassing around Columbia. Sunday promised a day full of visits to black churches in the state\\'s northeastern corner. \"Black women want you go come in and have a cup of tea,\" Carr said to the audience, as well as those watching via livestream. \"This is her having a virtual cup of tea\". South Carolina is a critical state for Harris and the other Democrats vying for their party\\'s nomination. The first Southern state to vote, it\\'s also the first to feature a heavily black electorate, where success can bode well for a candidate\\'s future in the other southern states whose primaries follow. Ahead of the round table, Harris officially signed her papers to be a candidate in South Carolina\\'s Democratic presidential primary, joining former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg on the ballot. Many Democratic hopefuls are courting the state\\'s black voters. But Harris\\' efforts underscore the emphasis that she is placing specifically on winning over black women, the Democratic Party\\'s most loyal and consistent voters. Languishing in many polls, Harris has lagged with black voters, who comprise about two-thirds of the state\\'s Democratic primary electorate. Campaign staffers continued to bring more chairs into the room throughout the event as more people filed in. The room was dotted with dozens of women decked out in the traditional pink and green of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Harris\\' sorority and network of support into which she has tapped in South Carolina and other places. Asked about hesitation she faces from voters skeptical of her past as a prosecutor, Harris said she knew she\\'d see some challenges but argued the importance of having a seat at the criminal justice table. \"I knew I was going up the rough side of the mountain,\" Harris said, of her decision to become a prosecutor, referencing a popular black gospel song, written by the Rev. Barnes and recorded by various artists. \"Prosecutors have an incredible amount of power. Don\\'t we want that the people who are making the decisions are also the people who attend our church, whose children play with our children. Don\\'t we want that? Are we saying that we should not be prosecutors?\". Lawrence called on the women in the room to be part of the history of Harris\\' campaign. \"The women sitting in this room are the hopes and dreams of slaves in this country,\" Lawrence said. \"How dare anyone in this room not exercise that right?\".

He is not about to start,\" Bloomberg chief adviser Howard Wolfson said in an interview. \"He cannot be bought\". One of the richest men in the world, Bloomberg is sending every indication he has decided to enter the crowded Democratic presidential primary election. In recent days, he has created a presidential campaign committee with the Federal Election Commission and qualified for the primary ballot in at least three states. Bloomberg\\'s team has reserved more than $30 million in television ads set to begin running Sunday in several primary states. The moves, just 10 weeks before primary voting begins in Iowa, reflects his concern that the current Democratic field is not well-positioned to defeat President Donald Trump next fall. Bloomberg\\'s wealth has already emerged as a central issue as the political world awaits his formal announcement. He is estimated to be one of the 10 richest people in the world. His Democratic rivals pounced on news of Bloomberg\\'s massive television ad buy, in addition to his decision to bypass the first four states on the presidential primary calendar — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — in favor of focusing on the many states that hold primary contests in March. \"I\\'m disgusted by the idea that Michael Bloomberg or any billionaire thinks they can circumvent the political process and spend tens of millions of dollars to buy elections,\" Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator, wrote Friday on Twitter. \"If you can\\'t build grassroots support for your candidacy, you have no business running for president\". Another Democratic candidate, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, swiped at Bloomberg as she campaigned over the weekend in New Hampshire. \"He didn\\'t want to deal with all of this grassroots campaigning from the beginning, you know that\\'s on him. I think this is important,\" Klobuchar said. She added, \"I think that you want to have a candidate for president who\\'s willing to go out, day after day, and talk to regular people like this\". Bloomberg\\'s team insists that his wealth allows him to be more responsive to the concerns of everyday people because he isn\\'t beholden to special interests. Wolfson said Bloomberg would work for only $1 a year as president, just as he did when he was New York City mayor for more than a decade. Bloomberg\\'s message on money is much the same one employed by Trump in his 2016 campaign, although Trump ultimately accepted millions of dollars in donations. Trump donates his salary each quarter to different departments of the federal government. Bloomberg \"is wholly independent of special interests, will not take a dime in any contribution, and never has in any of his three races,\" Wolfson said. The decision to refuse contributions would make it impossible for Bloomberg to participate any sanctioned Democratic debates should he run. The rules of entry, as set by the Democratic National Committee, currently require participants to meet a polling threshold and raise donations from tens of thousands of voters. Any money Bloomberg raises and spends on his presidential ambitions will come from one place: His own pocket. How much is he willing to spend. \"Whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump,\" Wolfson said. AP writer Sara Burnett in Henniker, New Hampshire contributed.LAS VEGAS (AP) — U.S. Rep. Dina Titus of Nevada is endorsing Joe Biden, becoming the first sitting member of Congress from an early voting state to endorse a presidential candidate. Titus says in a statement Monday that she feels Biden is the candidate best prepared to defeat President Donald Trump. The five-term congresswoman says she saw the former vice president help turn around the nation\\'s economy after the Great Recession and help get President Barack Obama\\'s signature health care law passed. She also says Biden will give Democrats their best chance to pass progressive reforms and won\\'t need any on-the-job training. Titus represents the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding areas. She\\'s one of the few members of Nevada\\'s congressional delegation that has not pledged to stay neutral ahead of the state\\'s February caucuses.BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — LSU coaches called one last play for running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire in hopes of getting him his fourth-straight 100-yard game. Perhaps it was only fitting that Edwards-Helaire, who needed just a yard, would break loose for a career-long 89-yard touchdown run. The top-ranked Tigers\\' new spread offense has been producing explosive plays all season — a big reason why they\\'ve booked a trip to the Southeastern Conference title game for the first time since 2011. Joe Burrow passed for 327 yards and three touchdowns, Edwards-Helaire rushed for a career-high 188 yards and three TDs and No. 1 LSU remained unbeaten with a 56-20 victory over reeling Arkansas on Saturday night. \"What a showing on offense — and we\\'re not done yet,\" Orgeron said, referring as much to all 11 games this season as to the Tigers\\' 612 total yards against Arkansas. LSU (11-0, 7-0) can finish no worse than in a tie for first with Alabama (10-1, 6-1) in the SEC West and owns the tiebreaker with its 46-41 triumph in Tuscaloosa on Nov. 9. \"We expected this coming into the year. If we were not 11-0 right now, we would be disappointed,\" Burrow said. \"That\\'s a testament to our hard work, but we\\'ve got more ahead of us\". Each time Edwards-Helaire broke loose for a score — his other TDs went for 27 and 26 yards — he left at least one defensive back grasping at air. On his 89-yarder, he was about to be caught from behind but used a high-step to slip the tackle before resuming his gallop to the goal line as the Tiger Stadium crowd roared for a Baton Rouge native having a career night. No one on defense could stop Clyde Edwards-Helaire 😳. (📍 @MercedesBenzUSA) pic.twitter.com/1tu2y5gIF2. \"I went in and it was like, \\'Get the yard, get out of bounds, shut it down for the rest of the game,\\'\" said Edwards-Helaire, who has 15 TDs rushing this season. \"But that hole parted like the Red Sea.\\'\". Burrow\\'s first touchdown was a 37-yarder to Ja\\'Marr Chase on the game\\'s first possession. They connected on a 50-yarder in the third quarter on which Burrow eclipsed 4,000 yards for the season and Chase increased in single-season LSU record for TD catches to 15. Burrow\\'s other touchdown toss was a 10-yarder on a crossing route to Justin Jefferson. Interim Arkansas coach Barry Lunney Jr. started freshman quarterback KJ Jefferson, who exhibited potential and athleticism, if not consistency. Jefferson, the fourth starting QB for the Razorbacks this season, completed 7 of 14 passes for 105 yards without a turnover. He also looked effective rushing at times, but his total in that department was skewed by three sacks. \"He competed hard but we didn\\'t have enough gas in our tank to hang with these guys for four quarters,\" Lunney said. The Razorbacks (2-9, 0-7), who\\'ve lost eight straight, were as close as 7-6 in the second quarter after Jefferson led them to their second field goal — a 47-yarder by Connor Limpert. That\\'s when LSU began to pull away. Burrow completed four quick passes for 66 yards to set up Tyrion Davis-Price\\'s 2-yard touchdown to make it 14-6. By halftime, the Tigers led 28-6. LSU led 56-6 on John Emery\\'s 39-yard run before Arkansas scored two late touchdowns, the second coming after an onside kick that squirted to the LSU 11 before the Razorbacks recovered. Arkansas: Lunney had the Hogs energized and playing hard throughout. They lost by less than the six-TD spread set by Las Vegas odds makers. Meanwhile, Jefferson was making a solid case to keep the starting job another week but left the game after taking a hard hit as he threw. Lunney said Jefferson would be evaluated for a concussion, but added, \"He\\'s very talented. There\\'s no doubt about that\". LSU: Burrow, a front-running candidate for the Heisman Trophy, completed 82 percent of his passes against Arkansas and now has 4,014 yards and 41 TDs passing this season, both LSU single-season records. Edwards-Helaire has been virtually unstoppable in LSU\\'s past four games, during which he\\'s piled up 814 yards and nine TDs from scrimmage. \"I knew he was going to have a lot of success for us and I knew that this offense fit him perfectly. We use him like that guy over there in New Orleans,\" Burrow said, referring to Saints running back Alvin Kamara. LSU post game pic.twitter.com/9wlyGgByNM. LSU defensive back Jacoby Stevens had all three LSU sacks and also batted a pass right back at him, which Jefferson caught for a completion to himself, albeit for a loss of 8 when Stevens immediately smothered him. LSU became the first team in SEC history to have a 4,000-yard passer (Burrow), two 1,000-yard receivers (Chase and Jefferson) and a 1,000-yard rusher (Edwards-Helaire) in the same season. While LSU won \"The Boot,\" a gold trophy in the shape of the states of Arkansas and Louisiana, the Tigers didn\\'t celebrate with it. \"There was going to be not too much of a celebration to beat Arkansas. They haven\\'t beat anybody in a long time,\" Orgeron said. \"We don\\'t feel like we\\'ve accomplished what we want to accomplish yet\". UP NEXT:. Arkansas: Tries to avoid a second-straight season with fewer than three victories when the Hogs host Missouri on Friday in their season finale.

(AP) — Jayden Daniels\\' big night on a prime-time national stage helped Arizona State stun No. 6 Oregon 31-28 Saturday night, giving the Sun Devils their biggest victory of the season. Daniels, a true freshman, completed 22 of 32 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns and Arizona State intercepted two of Justin Herbert\\'s passes in the fourth quarter. Arizona State (6-5, 3-5 Pac-12) ended Oregon\\'s College Football Playoff hopes and its nine-game winning streak. The Sun Devils snapped a four-game losing streak with their first victory over a top-five team since Oct. 14, 2017, against then No. Oregon (9-2, 7-1) has clinched the Pac-12 North title and a place in the conference championship game. But the Ducks\\' best-case scenario is likely the Rose Bowl. \"There\\'s lot of goals that go into a season. One of them was to have ourselves in a situation coming into this game to be part of every conversation and every kind of championship,\" Oregon coach Mario Cristobal said. \"But right now the only conversation that needs to take place for us as a team is the most logical one, that we get back to our process of being 1-0\". The Sun Devils held on after Oregon scored three touchdowns in a 6:38 span in the wild fourth quarter. The Ducks, down 24-7 with 8:42 to play, scored twice on three-play drives. It took them 59 seconds to make it 24-14 on Cyrus Habibi-Likio\\'s touchdown run, then 43 seconds to get Herbert\\'s scoring pass to Johnny Johnson III. Then, with Arizona State facing third-and-16, Daniels hit Brandon Aiyuk in stride for an 81-yard touchdown strike with 3:54 to play. Sun Devils coach Herm Edwards said play action was the key to Daniels\\' long completions. \"We just felt that our matchup with our receivers, that we had the ability to beat them. We wanted one-on-one matchups with their corners and we go it,\" Edwards said. Herbert and Johnson connected again for a touchdown with 2:04 left, but Arizona State was able to run out the clock. Daniels found holes in the secondary all night, hitting Frank Darby for touchdown passes of 57 and 26 yards. Daniels had eight completions of 17 yards or more as Arizona State scored 21 straight points after trailing 7-0 in the first quarter. Daniels completed his first 12 passes of the game. \"Just trust, that is what we wanted to do,\" Daniels said. \"That is the skill set that we have. Brandon, Frank, Eno (Benjamin) and me\". Aiyuk had seven catches for 161 yards, Darby finished with four catches for 125 yards and running back Benjamin had 168 total yards. Christian Zendejas made three short field goals, including a 22-yard kick for a 17-point lead. \"I came out here with a chip on my shoulder and I know they all did, too,\" Darby said. Herbert was 20 of 36 for 304 yards. Verdell rushed for 99 yards on 18 carries and Johnson had 10 catches for 207 yards. Arizona State got the game\\'s only two takeaways, the first an interception by Jack Jones on the first play of the fourth quarter. Four plays later, Daniels hit Darby in the back of the end zone for a 26-yard touchdown pass, then found Benjamin for the 2-point conversion and a 21-7 lead. \"They hit some big plays on us, some will be technique-oriented, some will be just them making a really good throw and catch,\" Cristobal said. \"Credit them for making those plays\". After throwing just one interception in the first eight games of the season, Herbert, once considered a Heisman Trophy contender, has four in his last three games. \"I made a bad decision and the defense made a play,\" Herbert said. \"We didn\\'t play like we could\". Aiyuk said he was glad to see Oregon in man-to-man coverage. \"They think they are big bad mighty Oregon, so I kind of had a feeling that they were going to come out and do what they do,\" Aiyuk said. \"Last year we had them talking to themselves. A lot of big talkers. They didn\\'t say too much today\". Oregon had to turn to starting right tackle Calvin Throckmorton to play center in the second half when Jake Hanson suffered an undisclosed injury. The Ducks\\' experienced offensive line held up fairly well, giving up two sacks but paving the way for 172 rushing yards. The Ducks were also without junior wide receiver Jaylon Redd, who was held out due to injury, and freshman sensation Mycah Pittman. Redd has 42 catches for 396 yards and seven touchdowns. Oregon: The Ducks will certainly fall in the College Football Playoff standings next week, and Herbert was inconsistent until the final minutes, when Oregon made a valiant comeback but couldn\\'t complete it. And a defense that had been one of the Pac-12′s best this season was torched for 535 total yards. Arizona State: The students rushed the field to celebrate the Sun Devils\\' signature win of the season, and it made them bowl eligible with their sixth win. They made enough defensive stops through three quarters to take a big lead and keep it, and ripped a secondary that came in with 17 interceptions on the season. \"I am happy to be bowl eligible to be quite honest,\" Edwards said. \"That is significant for us. We were tired of losing. We just got tired of losing because losing ain\\'t no fun for anybody\". Oregon hosts Oregon State in the Civil War rivalry game Saturday. Arizona State hosts Arizona in the Duel in the Desert game Saturday night. More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.BELLFLOWER, Calif. (AP) — On a typically perfect Southern California afternoon, bright sun and blue sky, the stars are out at St. John Bosco Prep football practice. The quarterback built like Jameis Winston? Five-star prospect, heading to Clemson. That chiseled linebacker with the square jaw? Four star, committed to Ohio State. That super-fast receiver? The other receiver is a four star, too. That OTHER receiver, the tall one? Four star, but he\\'s just a junior, like the other four-star linebacker. Couple three-star players on the offensive line. Another on the defensive line. There are few high school football teams anywhere in America as good as this, but one of them is just a 23-mile drive down Interstate 5. Bosco\\'s Trinity League rival, Mater Dei High School, is ranked No. 1 nationally after beating the Braves 38-24 in October, a matchup with enough high-end talent to make a top-40 recruiting class from just the seniors on each team. Bosco is ranked No. \"They\\'re just playing a different sport,\" Corona Del Mar High School football coach Danny O\\'Shea said of the private school powerhouses. The dichotomy of California high school football is glaring: The state\\'s best programs are among the very best in the country while the foundation is crumbling. Only Texas and Florida produce more major college football players than California, but overall participation in the sport fell almost 10% from 2015 to 2018, according to data compiled by the National Federation of State High School Associations. Texas and Florida added high school football players over that same period. The percentage of players competing at the highest level of college football who are from California has dropped over the last five years, too, from 11.5% in 2013 to 10.5% in 2018, according to the NCAA. This is problematic not just for those who love football in the Golden State, but for schools in the Pac-12 that are most reliant on California players. There are two more worrisome trends for the Pac-12: While the number of blue-chip recruits from California is still high, those top players have been passing on Pac-12 offers more frequently. National trends related to safety and youth sports specialization are taking a toll in California, but the top-heavy nature of the competition in the Los Angeles area, where many of the best players cluster to form super teams, appears to be compounding problems. Petro Papadakis, a former Southern California football player who is now an analyst for the Pac-12 Network, says the \"hometown vibe\" is gone. \"The overarching theme here is private schools and academies are kind of taking away the great Southern California high school football tradition that I grew up with,\" he said. \"We still have great football here. We still produce great players. But the academy part of it is bad, and the o-line, the no longer dedicating yourself to the fronts and this seven-on-seven culture in the summer, which is the furthest thing from real football you can have. We\\'ve kind of been led astray a little bit I guess would be a good way to put it\". Corona Del Mar offensive coordinator Kevin Hettig, who has been working with O\\'Shea for more than a decade, said they first saw signs of trouble for the public schools in 2008 when they were at Trabuco Hills High School and their best player left to play at Orange Lutheran. That was the start of an arms race in the Trinity League, which was formed in 2006. Bosco lagged its league competition for years before winning five championships over a seven-year span under head coach Jason Negro, who had been at Trabuco Hills. Mission Viejo head coach Chad Johnson was offensive coordinator at Bosco for eight years. He said public schools like his, especially city schools, face funding issues and less emphasis has been placed on sports programs. Meanwhile, private schools could offer top-flight competition, commitment to the football program and assistance with travel and tuition based on need. Bosco took advantage of a prime location, easily accessible by two major freeways to both Orange and Los Angeles counties, to draw players from all over, Johnson said. \"It was a sleeping giant,\" Johnson said. \"So we just woke it up\". Negro runs a brisk practice, broken into rigidly timed periods and with very little standing around by the players. Hip-hop music is the soundtrack. His goal is to make Bosco the best high school football program in the country. \"I mean people want to sit there and say you know oh they got this kid from here they got that kid from there, whatever,\" Negro said. \"Well, I mean as long as the rules are going to dictate what we can and cannot do and we follow those rules, I mean, I don\\'t think there should be making excuses for our success and trying to cast shadows on what we\\'re doing. You know when I was at the public school we had kids coming in from all over the place. We had transfers coming in from all over the place. \"The difference was that the level of play just wasn\\'t as high-caliber as the ones that I\\'m getting now,\" he said. \"I didn\\'t play in a league like I play now that was kind of forcing me to be as good as I possibly can be\". On this day, Bosco was preparing for a game at Mililani High School in Hawaii. The Braves also hosted DeMatha High School from Maryland earlier in the season and made a road trip to Bishop Gorman in Las Vegas. Bosco\\'s players are already part of a national program, so it\\'s no surprise they think big when they plot a course for their futures. Uiagalelei is the top-rated quarterback in the 2020 signing class. He is 6-foot-4, 245 pounds. He is committed to Clemson, where he plans to enroll early to compete against star quarterback Trevor Lawrence next year and play baseball, his first love, in the spring. Uiagalelei grew up rooting for the University of Southern California, like so many kids here, but when it came time to decide where he wanted to play in college he wanted more. \"I felt like I just want to play on the biggest stage\". he said. \"I wanted to play for a national championship. Just like I play for here, I want to play for a national championship every year. The Pac-12, for the most part, Pac-12 football is not the quality of football that I feel like is on the East Coast. Clemson, I feel like that\\'s the place. Every year they compete for a national championship ring. And right now the Pac 12 is not how the Pac-12 used to be when they used to have teams loaded like the old SC\". According to 247 Sports\\' player rankings, five of the top six California players from the class of 2020 are committed to schools outside the Pac-12, including Mater Dei quarterback Bryce Young, who flipped his commitment from USC to Alabama in September. And that doesn\\'t include the top-rated player in the state, running back Justin Flowe from Upland, who is strongly considering signing with Clemson. Through mid-November, 26% of the four- and five-star recruits in California are verbally committed to sign with non-Pac-12 schools. That\\'s in line with a recent trend: From 2002-14, 19.1% of California\\'s four and five stars (75 out of 393) signed outside the Pac-12. From 2015-19, that rose to 27.1% (69 out of 249). Ask anybody who has covered West Coast football for a while what is wrong with the Pac-12 and among the first answers will be: USC is not good enough. The Trojans have always been the West Coast\\'s marquee college football program, the one best positioned to be a national power thanks to its tradition of success and easy access to great athletes. But since the Pete Carroll, Reggie Bush glory days on the 2000s, the Trojans have churned through head coaches and rarely fielded teams capable of competing with the best of the best. Oregon has tried to fill that void. Utah has had success and this year has its best team since Urban Meyer was the coach 15 years ago. Washington has re-emerged as a perennial Pac-12 contender under coach Chris Petersen. But none have the Trojans\\' championship pedigree or national cache. \"They need to compete at a national level in order for people on the East Coast to pay attention,\" Papadakis said. \"People on the East Coast are conditioned to pay attention to USC. Underlying all this is a football culture in California that is not as strong as it is in other parts of the country, where the game is a way of life in many communities. \"There\\'s so many things that you can do in California that the kids are exposed to. that it\\'s not just all centered around football. It\\'s not just centered around these small towns (where) that\\'s the only way that I can get out to areas across the country,\" Negro said. \"I don\\'t necessarily see it at my level. You know my kids that are here, they want to focus on using our school as a platform to get to where they want to go, which is to play college football\". Follow Ralph D.

Otherwise, Young spent Saturday doing pretty much whatever he wanted for the Buckeyes. The defensive end returned from a two-game NCAA suspension and reinserted himself into the Heisman Trophy race with three sacks among four tackles for loss and nine tackles overall in Ohio State\\'s victory over Penn State. The most basic numbers hardly tell the full story. \"Oh my gosh,\" Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said. \"I think Chase Young deserves to be in New York. How dominant of a player is Chase Young? And the impact he has on the game is just unbelievable\". New York City is where the Heisman ceremony will be held on Dec. 14, and yes, Young should unquestionably be there as one of the finalists for college football\\'s most famous award. Young\\'s candidacy will test Heisman voters, but it should be an easy exam. There should be place for the most talented player in college football on every ballot even though history says a few things will work against him:. — Young\\'s position. No player who exclusively plays defense has ever won the award, but there have been a few in recent years who have been finalists. — Young missed two games. They weren\\'t big games, but missing games usually hurts a Heisman contender. — Young has two talented teammates on the other side of the ball who have played well enough to be in the Heisman conversation. None of that should deter Heisman voters. The question is not whether Young should be a finalist. Clearly, the answer is yes. Young has been so good, leading the nation with a school-record 16 sacks, that he will enter the last two games of the season with a chance to catch presumptive front-runner Joe Burrow from LSU and become the first defense-only Heisman winner. \"He\\'s an incredible player,\" Ohio State defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley said. \"If there\\'s a more dominant player in the country on defense, bring me the tape\". In April, Young will follow in the path of the Bosa brothers and become the latest Buckeyes pass rusher taken in the top five of the NFL draft. On Saturday, he broke the Ohio State record for sacks in a season previously held by Vernon Gholston, another former top-five pick. \"It means a lot. As an individual you have goals during the season. I reached one of my goals\". Young said. \"My teammates helped me do that, Coach J (Larry Johnson) and I have to give all glory to God\". Quarterbacks have had a lock on the Heisman for most of the last two decades. Since 2000, only three times has the award gone to non-quarterbacks. USC running back Reggie Bush won it in 2005 — and was stripped of the award because of NCAA violations. Alabama RBs Mark Ingram (2009) and Derrick Henry (2014) are the other players to break the run of quarterbacks. In the age of offense and with quarterbacks more efficient than ever before, it is understandable that the Heisman has become almost exclusively for passers. Burrow is on his way to a historic season, on pace to set records for completion percentage (78.9) and efficiency rating (203.66). He has thrown 4,014 yards, 41 touchdowns and just six interceptions for the No. 1 team in the country. Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was so good before being injured last week that he should still receive consideration. Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts is in the mix. Oklahoma State running back Chuba Hubbard and Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor are having sensational seasons. Then there are the other Buckeyes. Both quarterback Justin Field and running back J.K. Dobbins have been among the very best at their positions. And Young is still clearly the best player on his team. With offenses so explosive and quarterbacks more accurate than ever, Young is invaluable to the Buckeyes\\' top-ranked defense (3.52 yards per play). \"It allows us at times to rush three,\" Hafley said about the difference between having Young and not. \"It allows you to move him around. It allows you to put more in coverage and it takes away deep developing routes. It\\'s hard to drop back and sit in the pocket and throw the ball down the field on deeper developing routes with him in the game\". That was evident against Penn State, which all but abandoned its long-range game. Young has two more chances to make a statement: Saturday at No. 10 Michigan and then in the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 7. The following week he should be in the Big Apple, with a legitimate chance to make Heisman history. Follow Ralph D.

With the exception of two games played indoors — Saints 34, Panthers 31; Buccaneers 35, Falcons 22 — and a romp by the Titans in Music City, it was mostly a Sunday for those who enjoy defense. With a dash of the elements in some cases. Some poor officiating, unfortunately. And with some of the fiercest clean hits and brilliant scheming we\\'ve seen all season. Sure, this is a passing league, with offensive theatrics and big numbers on scoreboards the main attraction for so many these days. But to see what the Seahawks did in Philadelphia, even if the Eagles are a shell of the talented roster they had heading into the season, was impressive. The work of the Jets in an upset of Oakland has to have fans of Gang Green carrying some rare optimism. Buffalo\\'s D, which shut down spiraling Denver, is for real. So, of course, is top-rated New England\\'s, which it needs to be given the ordinariness (and injuries) on the other side of the ball. If the Patriots (10-1) finish with the AFC\\'s best record, it will be because of the defense. The lesson here is simple. When we reach November and December and you conduct your business outdoors, so many factors can affect your ability to run and pass. Even to kick, as we saw in Foxborough. Stopping opponents becomes extra critical; consider that, while it wasn\\'t exactly pleasant in Buffalo, Foxborough or New Jersey on Sunday, the conditions figure to get worse. Most impressive was Seattle winning its sixth straight away game. The Seahawks, once feared far more at home than on the road, clearly are a major championship contender because of their success outside of Seattle — particularly when their defense is immovable. \"I think it\\'s really worth noting how the defense played today,\" coach Pete Carroll said of their 17-9 victory that wasn\\'t so close. \"I thought they played great all day long. Obviously, we took the ball away from them a ton of times, five times I think today. We had four sacks. The pressure was there again like last week. \"We all wondered are we going to have pressure this week? And we didn\\'t have J.D. (Jadeveon Clowney) out there playing. Just thrilled for the guys up front that kept the heat coming and made it a hard day for their quarterback\". The Bills did the same against Denver\\'s Brandon Allen. It\\'s not the biggest achievement of the day, but don\\'t dismiss it. Under Sean McDermott, the Bills are easing the memories of that ridiculous non-playoff string that ended two years ago. They\\'re doing it with a defense that can slow pretty much anyone, and at 8-3, they\\'re on pace to make the postseason in the muddled and generally mediocre AFC. Also in the AFC East the disappointing Jets have begun resembling an NFL team, winning three in a row. The first two were over the weakling Giants and Redskins, but manhandling the contending Raiders should make folks take notice. Rookie Josh Jacobs, fourth in the NFL in rushing, was held to 34 yards on 10 carries. The Jets came in allowing a league-low 79.1 yards rushing, and gave up 68 to Oakland, and 208 total yards. \"We got our butts kicked,\" Carr said. \"There\\'s no other way around that. They got after us from start to finish. Hopefully, it\\'s an eye opener\". The eye opener for all of this should be that defenses — we didn\\'t even mention Baltimore or San Francisco, along with Seattle possibly the most dangerous teams in the league heading into Thanksgiving — can and will make a difference down the stretch. That\\'s quite refreshing to note given the emphasis on offense that extends even to the league office. Dak Prescott, whose Cowboys never got into the end zone and lost 13-9 at New England, recognizes what could be ahead for his team, and everyone around the NFL. \"Yeah, it\\'s tough,\" he said of the challenges presented now and in the near future — and not just by the Patriots. \"That defense is good, they\\'re well-coached, they don\\'t make mistakes. You add the conditions, it was tough. We once again made mistakes that hurt ourselves on third down. It\\'s always going to be tough to win a game, especially against a team like this on the road, in these conditions, when you\\'re not making plays and executing and being clean\". More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.ATLANTA (AP) — Vita Vea worked on the play during the final day of practice. Still, when he got the call from quarterback Jameis Winston, it was a bit of a shock. Even more stunning was the result. Vea, a 6-foot-4, 347-pound defensive lineman, hauled in a 1-yard touchdown with his first career catch, one of three scoring passes thrown by Winston to lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers past the Atlanta Falcons 35-22 on Sunday. \"I scored?\" Vea said, breaking into a hearty laugh. \"I thought it was a dream\". Winston shook off two more interceptions to post his sixth straight 300-yard passing game, leading the Buccaneers (4-7) to just their second victory in the last seven games. Chris Godwin had seven catches for a career-best 184 yards, including a pair of touchdowns. Yet the scoring play everyone will remember was a little 1-yard pass in the final minute of the first half to Vea, a 6-foot-4, 347-pound defensive lineman who has been used as an extra blocker on offense, but never as an offensive weapon. \"The first thing I hear out there is the pass play,\" Vea said, relating how he got the call. \"Jameis looked at me and was like, \\'Hurry up and get set, Vita.\\' And I was like, \\'Oh, damn, here it comes.\\'\". After lining up at fullback, Vea slipped into the flat on play-action by Winston, going completely uncovered as he gobbled up the short pass. \"For some reason, I thought somebody was behind me,\" said Vea, who had not scored a touchdown since he played running back in high school. \"So right when I caught the ball, I kind of braced for impact. But no one was there\". Atlanta (3-8) had pulled even with Tampa Bay at the bottom of the division standings with a modest two-game winning streak. But the Falcons couldn\\'t keep the momentum going, dropping to 1-4 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in what has become a lost season for a team that reached the Super Bowl just three years ago. They were officially eliminated from the NFC South race with five weeks left in the season. \"You\\'ve got to score touchdowns and we didn\\'t do a good job of that today,\" said Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who has his lowest-rated game of the season. Winston has been picked off an NFL-high 20 times but completed 18 of 28 for 313 yards. His top two receivers, Mike Evans and Godwin, both went past 1,000 yards receiving for the season. But how about that big guy who now has a single yard receiving. \"I knew he was going to catch the ball no matter where it was, but it was big for team morale to get him a touchdown,\" Winston said. Godwin put Tampa Bay ahead 7-3 with a 71-yard reception in the first quarter, the first TD allowed by the Falcons in more than 10 quarters. He lined up in the slot and caught the Falcons in a mismatch, beating linebacker Deion Jones. Atlanta reclaimed the lead on Qadree Ollison\\'s 1-yard leap into the end zone, but the Bucs took control with a dominating second quarter. Godwin reached back with one hand to make a brilliant grab for a 1-yard scoring play, and Vea\\'s TD stretched the margin to 19-10 at the break. It should have been more, but Matt Gay yanked a couple of extra points wide left. Tampa Bay took the second-half kickoff and extended the margin, going 75 yards in nine plays capped by 4-yard touchdown run by Ronald Jones II. The Bucs again failed to convert the extra point, this time when Gay\\'s attempt was blocked. The kicking woes became a moot point thanks to the Bucs\\' defensive dominance. Devin White had two of his team\\'s six sacks, and Tampa Bay finished off the rout by knocking away the ball from Ryan on a fourth-down play in the closing minutes. Ndamukong Suh scooped it up and rumbled 6 yards for a touchdown. Vea also dumped Ryan in the fourth quarter, giving him a memorable sack-TD catch double on the day. \"I still don\\'t believe it,\" Vea said. \"It still seems kind of surreal to me\". Evans joined Randy Moss as the only players to begin their careers with six straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving. It wasn\\'t a huge day for Evans, who was limited to 50 yards on four catches. Still, it pushed him to 1,043 yards for the season and part of a select club. \"He was a freak of nature,\" Evans said of Moss. \"He was so exciting to watch. To be in the same sentence as him is amazing\". Buccaneers: LB White was able to return after being ordered off the field by the officials early in the second half after a helmet-to-helmet hit with teammate Andrew Adams. DL Beau Allen (stinger) and CB Sean Murphy-Bunting (knee) were injured in the second half. Falcons: WR Julio Jones sustained a shoulder injury in the first half but finished with five catches for 68 yards, going past Calvin Johnson for 30th place on the NFL\\'s career receiving list with 11,681 yards. Buccaneers: Travel to Jacksonville to face the Jaguars next Sunday, beginning a stretch of three games in four weeks against AFC South opponents. Falcons: Short turnaround before they host first-place New Orleans on Thursday night. Atlanta will be going for its second straight upset of the Saints, having pulled off a 26-9 stunner in the first meeting between the NFC South rivals on Nov. 10.

The top-ranked Spanish star even admitted he risked getting injured by playing eight matches — five singles, three doubles — in six days at the Davis Cup Finals, the new World Cup of men\\'s team tennis. Nadal won all his matches, leading Spain to its sixth Davis Cup with a victory over first-time finalist Canada on Sunday. But in Nadal\\'s opinion, the only hero for Spain was grieving teammate Roberto Bautista Agut. He sent Spain on its way to victory by winning the first singles match on Sunday, three days after the death of his father. \"I\\'ve won the eight matches but the person who was vital in this Davis Cup was Roberto,\" Nadal said. \"For me, what he did was something almost (super) human. I don\\'t know how to explain it. It will be an example for the rest of my life. He had to leave, then his dad died, then he came back and practiced with us yesterday, and today he was ready again to play at a very high level. It was something incredible\". Before Nadal defeated Denis Shapovalov 6-3, 7-6 (7) to clinch the title — Spain\\'s first since also winning at home in 2011 — Bautista Agut had given Spain a 1-0 lead by beating Félix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (3), 6-3. Bautista Agut pointed his finger to the sky after winning the final point in his match, and was in tears while speaking briefly to the crowd, which chanted his name. \"It was an amazing feeling on the court today,\" said Bautista Agut, who was the Spanish player lifting the cup in the title celebrations. Bautista Agut\\'s father died on Thursday — a day after his son had defeated Nikola Mektic of Croatia — with his health deteriorating quickly after an illness that stemmed from a 2016 accident. It was Nadal who had tears in his eyes when Bautista Agut thanked him for his efforts during the tournament. \"You gave us goosebumps all week, especially today,\" Bautista Agut said. \"Thank you. I\\'m sure that next year you will do it again\". The 31-year-old Bautista Agut, No. 9 in the world, played as teammates Pablo Carreño Busta and Marcel Granollers nursed injuries entering the final. \"I had the opportunity to play today because all the team and all the players did an unbelievable effort since the first day,\" Bautista Agut said. Nadal considered himself lucky to be able to play all matches. \"It\\'s true that I held up, but we know that playing so many matches in this (hard court) surface is risky for me, something can happen at any time,\" Nadal said. \"That\\'s how it\\'s been in the past, but luckily I held up\". Spain\\'s Marcel Granollers and Feliciano López had been scheduled to face Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil in the now canceled doubles, although Nadal was likely to play if the title had been at stake. Nadal played in the decisive doubles on Friday and Saturday. Voted the tournament\\'s best player, Nadal sealed the title with his 29th straight Davis Cup singles win, igniting the home crowd\\'s celebrations. Tournament organizer and Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqué, his wife Shakira — who performed in the closing ceremony — and Spanish King Felipe VI were among those celebrating Spain\\'s triumph. Spain\\'s other Davis Cup titles were in 2000, \\'04, \\'08, \\'09 and \\'11. Canada was seeking its first Davis Cup title since debuting in the competition in 1913. \"I feel like we\\'ve really come really far as a team, as a nation,\" the 20-year-old Shapovalov said. \"Definitely we\\'re super proud. Obviously it sucks, sucks losing in the finals. But I\\'m super proud of everyone. We\\'ve put in 120% every single day. It\\'s amazing how far we\\'ve been able to come\". The Canadians eliminated Italy and the United States in the group stage, and Australia and Russia in the knockout rounds. The 19-year-old Auger-Aliassime lost to Bautista Agut while making his debut in this year\\'s tournament. He was coming off an ankle injury that had seen him sidelined through the group stage and the quarterfinals and semifinals. Canada came to Madrid without Milos Raonic because of a back injury. Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil were the only players who had competed until Sunday. Spain beat Russia and Croatia in the group stage, and Argentina and Britain in the knockout rounds. The new Davis Cup Finals is the result of a 25-year partnership between the International Tennis Federation and the Kosmos group co-founded by Piqué. For the first time, 18 nations played in the same venue in a single week, instead of head-to-head matches that used to take place over four weekends throughout the year.

Montrezl Harrell has remained one of the few constants. Harrell showed again on Sunday night that he shouldn\\'t be overlooked despite the additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. The fifth-year forward tied a career high with 34 points as the Clippers beat the New Orleans Pelicans 134-109 for their fifth straight win. \\'They are starting to see Montrez is good. He can score a lot of different ways and it seems like each year he is adding more to his game,\" Rivers said. \"He went left a couple times tonight when the scouting report is to not have him go right\". It is the fifth 30-point game of Harrell\\'s career and the second time he has scored 34 this season (the other was Nov. 6 against Milwaukee). He was 13 of 18 from the field and grabbed 12 rebounds as he led the Clippers in scoring for the fourth time this season. Leonard scored 24 points, Lou Williams added 19 and Paul George had 18 for the Clippers, who have won 11 of 12 at home. \"It is great that we can still be able to run and collect wins while we are still adjusting,\" Harrell said. \"We\\'re a deep team and anyone can have a big night\". Brandon Ingram, one of three Lakers players involved in the Anthony Davis trade, led New Orleans with 24 points and eight rebounds in his first game back at Staples Center. Jrue Holiday scored 18 and E\\'Twaun Moore had 17. \"There have been a couple times where we\\'ve been down and try to fight back and it has been a little too hard with the deficits. I feel like that has been the standard so far,\" Holliday said. JJ Redick and Holiday hit 3-pointers to give the Pelicans a 10-6 lead three minutes into the game before the Clippers took control with a 15-4 run. George keyed the run with a pair of 3s and Leonard added five. Los Angeles led 40-27 and then increased it to 62-37 on George\\'s 3 with 5:55 remaining in the first half. \"The slow starts are killing us. You can\\'t give up 40 in a quarter unless you are going to score 45, and we weren\\'t going to score 45 against that team,\" Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. The Clippers went into halftime with a 72-56 advantage before New Orleans cut the lead in half with an 11-3 run to start the third quarter. Jaxson Hayes\\' layup drew the Pelicans to 86-80 with 4:53 remaining in the quarter but that would be as close as they got as Los Angeles countered with an 11-2 run, which included Harrell scoring the last six points. \"They cut it to six and we got it right back up. I thought our guys got back to playing,\" Rivers said. LONG DISTANCE CLIPS. In the three games that Leonard and George have played together, the Clippers are averaging 15.3 3-pointers per game, which is five more than the first 14 games. Los Angeles had 16 3-pointers on Sunday with eight players hitting from beyond the arc. George led the way with six 3s. \"Everyone is trapping on us but we are moving the ball and getting great looks. They\\'re wide open, so we better take them,\" Rivers said. Pelicans: Lonzo Ball, who was also involved in the Davis trade, had nine points and five assists. He received some boos from the crowd when he entered the game in the first quarter. Reddick had 12 points. C Jahlil Okafor returned to the lineup after missing four games due to a left ankle sprain and had 10 points along with six rebounds. Josh Hart missed his fourth straight game due to a sprained left ankle. Clippers: Ivica Zubac had 10 rebounds before fouling out. Patrick Beverley had 10 points. This was the second time this season Los Angeles has scored 70 or more points in the first half.

He has lauded Tottenham\\'s training complex as being \"second to none\" and without comparison across Europe \"at any level\". He says he has slept in the club\\'s pajamas at its on-site hotel which he rates as \"six star,\" with its \"soft pillows, amazing duvet\". Now it\\'s time for a first taste of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium — \"the best stadium in the world,\" he has purred — as Mourinho continues his quest to win over fans who might still be skeptical about his appointment. Getting the team through to the knockout stage of the Champions League wouldn\\'t do him any harm in the ingratiation process. Three days after guiding Spurs to a Premier League victory at West Ham in his first match since replacing Mauricio Pochettino, Mourinho will take charge of them in a home match for the first time when Olympiakos visits Tuesday in the Champions League. A victory guarantees progress out of Group B alongside Bayern Munich with a game to spare. It would complete a decent week\\'s work for Mourinho as he attempts to rebuild his coaching reputation after a fractious, and ultimately disappointing, 2½ year spell at Manchester United that ended almost 12 months ago. The Portuguese coach hugged his players and kept a respectful distance from the traveling Spurs fans while he celebrated the 3-2 win against West Ham on Saturday. It might take some time for them to accept Mourinho and take him to their hearts, especially considering the work Pochettino did in raising standards at Tottenham — even getting the team to a Champions League final last season when it lost to Liverpool. Mourinho has done that with Porto and Inter Milan, winning the title match on both occasions, so is seeking to become the first manager to win European club soccer\\'s biggest prize with three different clubs — all from different countries. None of them could be classed as modern-day continental heavyweights, either, making that achievement all the more impressive. \"The gaffer\\'s won at every club he\\'s gone to — there\\'s no hiding away from that,\" Tottenham striker Harry Kane said. \"He wants to win. He\\'s a proven winner. I\\'ve made it clear that I\\'m at the stage of my career where I want to win trophies. \"Realistically we look at the Champions League and the FA Cup this season to try and do that. You could say that (Mourinho could make the difference) because of his reputation. It\\'s been three days so, until we build that relationship and see how things get on over the next two or three months, we won\\'t really know\". The closest Mourinho has come to winning the Champions League since that 2010 triumph with Inter was a trio of semifinal appearances — all with Real Madrid — in 2011, \\'12 and \\'13. He got Manchester United out of its group last season, only to get fired before the knockout stages even began. If he was happy to be back in the Premier League — his \"natural habitat,\" he called it — at the weekend, imagine how he will feel making a return to the Champions League arena. \"Give me time, give me time to develop my ideas and we will have no problem going to play any team in Europe,\" Mourinho said Monday. \"We are not afraid of anyone\". Three teams have already qualified after four of the six rounds of games: Bayern, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. Seeking a win to advance along with Juventus in Group D, Atletico Madrid is well aware of the dangers of a rested Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo took some time off before the second leg of the last 16 in the Champions League last season and responded with a hat trick against the Spanish team as Juventus overturned a 2-0 deficit. Ronaldo was rested again at the weekend, for Juve\\'s 3-1 win at Atalanta, as he continues to recover from a knee injury. Ronaldo showed little sign of any problem while playing for Portugal in the recent European Championship qualifiers, scoring a hat trick in one match and also netting in another. Juventus is looking to secure top spot in the group with a win on Tuesday. FAVRE UNDER PRESSURE. Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has little room for error ahead of the side\\'s trip to Barcelona on Wednesday. A win would put the German side, which is a point behind first-place Barca in Group F, through to the knockout stage, but the manner of Dortmund\\'s performance will have a big say in Favre\\'s future. Dortmund fans reacted with fury after a 3-3 draw with last-place Paderborn in the Bundesliga on Friday, berating the players after their latest lackluster performance in a signal that their patience is wearing thin. Barcelona can seal first place in the group with a win. Real Madrid can qualify from Group A — and gain a measure of revenge — by beating PSG on Tuesday. PSG overwhelmed Madrid 3-0 in Paris in September, a result that left Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane under some pressure. \"We\\'re in better shape,\" said Zidane, whose team is only behind Barcelona in the Spanish league on goal difference. \"We had a tough game in Paris, but that\\'s in the past\". Group C leader Manchester City will advance by beating Shakhtar Donetsk at home on Tuesday. Liverpool has a one-point lead over Napoli heading into their meeting Wednesday in Group E, in which Salzburg is a further four points back before its game against out-of-contention Genk. In Group H, Ajax, Chelsea and Valencia are all on seven points. Valencia hosts Chelsea on Wednesday, when Ajax travels to Lille. In Group G, Leipzig and Lyon can advance by beating Benfica and Zenit St. Petersburg, respectively, on Wednesday. More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports. Steve Douglas is at www.twtter.com/sdouglas80.CINCINNATI (AP) — Devlin \"Duck\" Hodges took over for struggling Mason Rudolph and threw a 79-yard touchdown pass Sunday, sparking the depleted Pittsburgh Steelers to a 16-10 victory that kept the Cincinnati Bengals the only winless team in the NFL. Hodges connected with James Washington on the game-turning play in the third quarter, leaving Pittsburgh (6-5) with a quarterback decision as it moves forward without Ben Roethlisberger. The Steelers\\' defense has steadied them through the transition, and it had a major impact in Pittsburgh\\'s 10th straight win over the hapless Bengals (0-11), who set franchise records for worst start and longest losing streak. Tyler Boyd made a catch and was stripped by Devin Bush at the Steelers 8-yard line in the fourth quarter, preserving the lead. Bud Dupree sacked Ryan Finley and forced a fumble that he recovered with 2:38 left, closing it out. What\\'s left of the Steelers\\' offense — hollowed out by injuries and a suspension — struggled in the first half and prompted coach Mike Tomlin to switch from Rudolph to Hodges, who provided an immediate boost. His touchdown pass to Washington gave the Steelers a 10-7 lead and got thousands of Terrible Towels twirling at Paul Brown Stadium. Hodges filled in for one game after Rudolph suffered a concussion and directed a 24-17 win over the Chargers on Oct. 13. Tomlin went back to Rudolph as soon as he was healthy. Now, he\\'s got a big decision as the Steelers try to stay in the playoff chase. Hodges ran an offense missing three stars after a 21-7 loss to Cleveland that ended with ugliness — Myles Garrett clubbing Rudolph with the QB\\'s own helmet. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey served the first of his two-game suspension Sunday for kicking and punching Garrett in the melee. Also, receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was out with a concussion and running back James Conner had a shoulder injury from the Cleveland game. The Steelers got what they needed out of what was left, with Hodges leading the way. He went 5 of 11 or 118 yards with two sacks. Rookie Benny Snell Jr. returned from a knee injury and ran for 98 yards. If the Bengals were going to end that long losing streak against their Ohio River rival, this was their chance. Instead, they saw another one slip away in the end, just like all the others. The Bengals repeatedly dodged disaster in the first half and led 7-3, only their third halftime lead this season. They fumbled the opening kickoff but recovered. Finley was sacked and fumbled on Cincinnati\\'s second possession, but Giovani Bernard fell on the ball. Finley later was sacked just in front of the goal line, avoiding a safety. Finley was 12 of 26 for 192 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown pass to Boyd. Steelers: CB Artie Burns was out with a knee injury. Bengals: Alex Redmond was expected to start at left guard but hurt his left elbow during pregame warmups and didn\\'t play. Steelers: Host Cleveland next Sunday. Bengals: Host the New York Jets next Sunday.

How long before a slew of other teams — including Tottenham\\'s north London neighbor, Arsenal — opt to make a coaching change, too. Hours after Tottenham beat West Ham 3-2 in Mourinho\\'s first match in charge since replacing Mauricio Pochettino, Arsenal needed an injury-time goal to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to relegation candidate Southampton. It\\'s just one victory in its last seven matches for Arsenal in the league and boos rang around Emirates Stadium at the final whistle, directed as much at manager Unai Emery as his underperforming players. Then there\\'s Everton manager Marco Silva, who is also under mounting pressure after his team lost 2-0 at home to Norwich, which started the game in last place. Languishing in 15th place despite a benign run of fixtures to start the season, Everton has a grueling schedule for the next two months — including matches against second-placed Leicester (twice), Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City. And what about West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini, vanquished by Mourinho and overseeing a team that has collected just two points from the last seven games to plummet to 16th place? West Ham has conceded three goals for three straight games and its jittery goalkeeper, Roberto, received sarcastic cheers from his own fans every time he collected the ball without making a mistake. Tottenham has none of these concerns now, having boldly decided to cut ties with Pochettino this week and bring in Mourinho after nearly a year out of coaching. Portraying himself as humble and emotionally strong after his turbulent last spell at Manchester United, Mourinho hugged his new players and kept a respectful distance from the travelling Spurs fans while he celebrated a win earned by goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura, and Harry Kane in a 13-minute spell around halftime. \"Today I was where I belong,\" Mourinho said. \"That\\'s my natural habitat. Was I extra emotional? Was I nervous? But I just love it, especially when things go in your direction. Of course, the best thing in football is to win matches\". That\\'s something Liverpool cannot stop doing. It\\'s 12 wins in 13 for the leader after it beat Crystal Palace 2-1, courtesy of a late goal in a campaign full of them, to maintain its eight-point lead. There were also wins for Leicester, 2-0 at Brighton, and Manchester City, which defeated Chelsea 2-1 to climb above its beaten opponent into third. REDS LEAVE IT LATE. Roberto Firmino was the late match-winner for Liverpool this time, the Brazil striker lashing home a close-range finish in the 85th minute to secure a victory that didn\\'t look like coming at times. \"Could we have played better? Yes, but we had players on the pitch who on Thursday morning were still on a plane,\" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said in reference to the recent international break. Wilfried Zaha equalized in the 82nd for Palace with his first goal of the season after Sadio Mane\\'s opener for Liverpool in the 49th. Liverpool extended its unbeaten run in the division to 30 games. Jamie Vardy scored for a fifth straight game to guide Leicester to a sixth straight win in all competitions — but his latest goal had a hint of controversy about it. Leicester was already 1-0 up through Ayoze Perez when VAR came to prominence in the 80th after substitute Demarai Gray was adjudged to have been fouled in the area. After a VAR review, referee Mike Dean awarded Leicester a penalty, Vardy\\'s attempt was saved and James Maddison headed in the rebound. VAR intervened again, saying there had been encroachment by Maddison and Brighton players, and the decision was made to retake the penalty. Vardy made no mistake for his league-leading 12th goal. Man City avoided slipping 12 points behind Liverpool by coming from behind to beat Chelsea in an end-to-end encounter at Etihad Stadium. N\\'Golo Kante gave Chelsea the lead in the 21st minute but that was canceled out by Kevin De Bruyne\\'s deflected effort in the 29th. Riyad Mahrez cut inside from the right and fired a low shot into the corner for the winning goal in the 37th. Raheem Sterling had an injury-time goal for City ruled out by VAR for a marginal offside. WINS FOR WOLVES, BURNLEY. Wolverhampton beat 10-man Bournemouth 2-1 to climb to fifth place and make it eight games unbeaten in the league. Burnley won 3-0 at Watford, which returns to the bottom of the standings. More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports.

The Buckeyes got nine first-place votes, up from five last week. 3 Clemson received three first-place votes. 4 Georgia and No. 5 Alabama also held their spots. Ohio State is coming off a 28-17 victory over Penn State that dropped the Nittany Lions three spots to No. Oregon dropped eight spots to No. 14 after losing 31-28 at Arizona State. That allowed Utah to move up a spot to No. 6 and Oklahoma to No. Florida, Minnesota and Michigan round out the top 10. Alabama has now been ranked for 209 consecutive weeks, starting with the 2008 preseason poll, tying Florida (Sept. 9, 1990-Oct. 5, 2002) for the third-longest streak in poll history. Nebraska has the longest streak at 348 weeks (21 years, Oct. 12, 1981-Sept. 22, 2002) and Florida State is second with 211 weeks (12 years, Sept. 24, 1989-Nov. 11, 2001). The Tide should tie Bobby Bowden\\'s Seminoles this season and surpass them in next year\\'s preseason poll. There are typically 16 polls in a season, counting preseason and final.

Clifford went down awkwardly, with his right leg getting caught underneath his body. He managed to complete a pass on the play but stayed down and came off the field walking gingerly but without assistance. Penn State coach James Franklin said Clifford could have come back in, but his mobility would have been limited. He chose to stick with Levis and the sophomore provided a spark with his legs — at least for a little while. Levis helped Penn State complete a 75-yard touchdown drive, capped by Journey Brown\\'s 18-yard run, to make it Ohio State 21-7 with 8:19 left in the third quarter. A fumble by Ohio State on its next offensive play set up Penn State in the red zone, and Levis ran for a 1-yard score to make it 21-14 moments later. Another Ohio State fumble led to a Penn State field goal that cut the lead to 21-17, but that was a close as it got. With Levis, the Nittany Lions leaned heavy on the run, and eventually they couldn\\'t make enough plays. Levis finished with 34 yards rushing on 19 carries that included five sacks. He was 6 for 11 for 57 yards passing and threw an interception in the fourth quarter that ended Penn State\\'s last trip into Buckeyes\\' territory on the day. The Nittany Lions lost 28-17. They finish the regular season next week against Rutgers at home with a chance to finish 10-2 and be in consideration for a major bowl game.

Frank Gore recalls the doubters suggesting he wasn\\'t supposed to last two years in the NFL after tearing both his knees at college. Fifteen years later, Gore\\'s still going. With 65 yards rushing in a Buffalo\\'s 20-3 win over Denver on Sunday, the 36-year-old moved ahead of boyhood idol Barry Sanders and into third on the NFL list with 15,289 career yards rushing. The milestone led to the Bills issuing a video featuring congratulatory messages from Sanders, all-time rushing leader Emmitt Smith and several of Gore\\'s former teammates. \"Congratulations on becoming the No. 3 all-time rusher in the NFL,\" Sanders said. \"Keep up the great work\". Added Smith: \"Job well done\". The montage also included messages from Gore\\'s former University of Miami teammates Clinton Portis and Willis McGahee, as well as Ken Dorsey, now the Bills quarterbacks coach. Gore\\'s son, Frank Jr., was also featured, saying: \"I just want to say thank you for everything you\\'ve done for me\". Gore credited his late mother, who raised him, as well as the San Francisco 49ers for believing enough to select him in the third round of the 2005 draft. \"I\\'ve been doubted my whole career, not just the NFL,\" said Gore, who also passed Marshall Falk for fourth place with 19,155 career yards from scrimmage. \"I\\'m still having fun. Still making plays, still helping a team win games. I\\'m blessed\". The Dallas Cowboys held on defense, giving themselves a final chance to rally past New England. The Cowboys trail 13-9 with 2:38 left in the fourth quarter, and they\\'ll have to drive 92 yards for a touchdown. Dallas kicked a 29-yard field goal on its previous possession, rather than going for it on fourth-and-7 with just over 6:00 remaining. They were able to force a New England punt, however, so now they have a chance to win the game in regulation. The Tennessee Titans are rolling over the Jacksonville Jaguars after scoring three touchdowns in the first 4:36 of the third quarter. Derrick Henry scored two in the span of 16 seconds. The Titans opened the second half with a drive capped by Ryan Tannehill\\'s 1-yard TD pass to offensive lineman Dennis Kelly. Tennessee forced the Jaguars into a three-and-out. On the Titans\\' next play from scrimmage, Henry went through the line to the left sideline and ran 74 yards for a TD. Then Daren Bates forced a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and Henry ran 7 yards for a TD on the next play for a 28-3 lead. — Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville, Tennessee. Ryan Tannehill went to the air to help the Tennessee Titans take a 7-3 halftime lead over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The quarterback who ran hurdles and long jumped in high school ran for a 21-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Tannehill finished off by leaping at the goal line in an attempt to jump past Jaguars cornerback Tre Herndon. Herndon made contact with Tannehill, but the Tennessee quarterback landed in the end zone. The Jaguars managed a 49-yard field goal from Josh Lambo late in the first half. — Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville, Tennessee. N\\'Keal Harry has joined a not-very-exclusive club. The New England rookie caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Tom Brady in the first quarter of Sunday\\'s game against the Dallas Cowboys. Harry is the 75th player to catch a TD pass from Brady, extending an NFL record. Vinny Testaverde was second, with 70 different TD targets. A first-round draft choice from Arizona State, Harry made his NFL debut last week after spending 10 weeks on injured reserve with an ankle injury. It was the 15th touchdown pass of the season for Brady. That\\'s a record for a player after his 42nd birthday. The Patriots lead 10-0 in the second quarter. — Jimmy Golen reporting from Foxborough, Massachusetts. A rare pass interference-related overturn gave Carolina a new set of downs, but the Panthers couldn\\'t take advantage late in their game at New Orleans. Kyle Allen\\'s third-down pass was called incomplete, but after a review, a pass interference call was made against the Saints. That gave the Panthers a new set of downs at the New Orleans 3-yard line, but the Saints held defensively, and Joey Slye missed a 28-yard field goal attempt with 1:56 remaining, leaving the score tied at 31. Kyle Allen threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore on fourth down to pull the Carolina Panthers into a 31-all tie with New Orleans with 9:23 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Panthers trailed 31-18 in the third before rallying. The touchdown by Moore was his second of the game and the third TD pass by Allen. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz went to the sideline medical tent and then jogged to the locker room to get an apparent injury checked out, but he ended up staying in the game. There was no immediate word on the reason Wentz went to the locker room, but he appeared to injure his right hand and was shaking it for several series. He appeared to aggravate it on a muffed handoff that led to a Seattle fumble recovery. The Eagles trail Seattle 17-3 in the fourth quarter. — Dan Gelston reporting from Philadelphia. Derek Carr\\'s day appears to be over early against the New York Jets. Coach Jon Gruden pulled the Oakland quarterback with less than two minutes left in the third quarter and the Raiders trailing 34-3. Carr was 15 of 27 for 127 yards — and he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Brian Poole. Mike Glennon replaced Carr and immediately fumbled the first snap he got from center Rodney Hudson. The Jets recovered, but then fumbled away themselves. It didn\\'t appear it was an injury for Carr, who stood on the Raiders\\' sideline wearing a knit cap after being pulled. — Dennis Waszak Jr. reporting from East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Chicago Bears took a 19-7 lead by outscoring the New York Giants 16-0 in the third quarter. Mitchell Trubisky threw for a touchdown and ran for another during the third — although he began the fourth quarter with an interception that gave the Giants the ball around midfield. The Giants have lost six straight games. The Philadelphia Eagles have turned the ball over three times and trail Seattle 10-3 after three quarters. Carson Wentz has thrown for only 100 yards and was intercepted once. The Eagles have also lost two fumbles. The Seahawks had only eight first downs through three quarters, but their defense was playing well enough to keep the lead. The New York Jets have opened a 34-3 lead on Oakland after scoring three touchdowns in the first 8 ½ minutes of the third quarter. Sam Darnold threw a pair of short touchdown passes, then Brian Poole intercepted a pass by Derek Carr and took it back 15 yards for another TD. The Jets appear well on their way to a third straight victory after starting the season 1-7. The Steelers turned to third-string quarterback Devlin Hodges in the second half against Cincinnati, benching struggling Mason Rudolph, and they got instant results. Hodges threw a 79-yard touchdown pass to James Washington for a 10-7 lead. Rudolph was only 8 of 16 for 85 yards with a tipped interception. — Joe Kay reporting from Cincinnati. Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey cut New Orleans\\' lead to 17-15 at halftime with a touchdown as time ran out in the second quarter, but only after an unnecessary roughness penalty by Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan wiped out a third-down sack. Jordan appeared to be trying to punch the ball loose from quarterback Kyle Allen, who had been wrapped up by linebacker Demario Davis, but the whistle had already blown and Jordan missed the ball, instead appearing to smack his forearm into Allen\\'s head. Instead of fourth-and-long, the Panthers had first down and continued the drive. McCaffrey initially was ruled to have scored on a screen pass with 2 seconds left, but he was ruled down less than a yard short of the goal line after replay review. Instead of kicking a field goal, the Panthers lined up as if they were intending to run McCaffrey to the right, and the blocking all went that way as the ball was snapped. But McCaffery leaked out to the left for another screen and no defender shadowed him. McCaffrey celebrated the easy touchdown by spiking the ball so hard it landed in the stands. Carolina attempted to pass for a 2-point conversion, but that failed, allowing New Orleans to keep a slim lead at halftime. — Brett Martel reporting from New Orleans. Mike Evans has joined Randy Moss as the only players to begin their careers with six straight seasons of at least 1,000 yards receiving. Evans had a slow start in Tampa Bay\\'s game against Atlanta before making a 17-yard catch late in the first half to extend a drive. Evans began the day with 993 yards on 58 catches. The Buccaneers lead the Falcons 19-10 at halftime. —Charles Odum reporting from Atlanta. Cincinnati and Washington — who entered this weekend with a combined record of 1-19 — both have halftime leads. The winless Bengals are up 7-3 on Pittsburgh. Cincinnati fumbled opening kickoff but recovered, Ryan Finley fumbled on a sack but the Bengals recovered. Also, the Bengals intercepted a pass at their own 3-yard line, so things have really gone their way — which is what they need to have a chance. The Redskins hadn\\'t led at any point since beating Miami in Week 6, but they are ahead of Detroit 13-6. The Lions are playing their third straight game without injured quarterback Matthew Stafford. Bills quarterback Josh Allen threw his first interception in his last 172 attempts in the second quarter when he was picked off by Broncos safety Justin Simmons. It was his first interception since being picked off in the third quarter of a 14-7 win over Tennessee in Week 5. It was also Buffalo\\'s first turnover in three-plus games; Buffalo had never gone four games in a row without a turnover. The Bills lead Denver 6-0. — John Wawrow reporting from Orchard Park, New York. Jarvis Landry is getting revenge against his former team. Landry caught two touchdown passes from Baker Mayfield as Cleveland opened a 21-0 lead over the Miami Dolphins. Landry spent four seasons with the Dolphins, who traded him to Cleveland in 2018 after they decided not to give the three-time Pro Bowler a long-term contract. Landry said earlier this week that he had circled the matchup with Miami on his calendar. He opened the scoring with a 7-yard TD reception and later scored on a 5-yard pass from Mayfield, who also threw a 35-yard TD to Odell Beckham Jr. —Tom Withers reporting from Cleveland. The Buffalo Bills scored field goals on their opening two drives and lead the Denver Broncos 6-0 in the second quarter. Buffalo opened the scoring on Stephen Hauschka\\'s 39-yard field goal that capped a 17-play, 69-yard drive in which the Bills converted three third-down opportunities. The Bills followed with a 12-play, 87-yard drive that stalled at Denver\\'s 5, leading to Hauschka\\'s 23-yard field goal. — John Wawrow reporting from Orchard Park, New York. New Orleans scored two touchdowns less than 10 minutes into its game against Carolina, in part because of a successful challenge by Saints coach Sean Payton. Officials initially ruled a Saints punt was touched first by New Orleans and was not a fumble when the ball came down in a cluster of players. Replay showed the ball deflecting off of Panthers safety Rashaan Gaulden, and New Orleans, which had recovered the loose ball, took possession on the Carolina 27. A couple plays later, Tre\\'Quan Smith had an easy touchdown reception when Carolina\\'s defense froze on a play fake in the backfield to running back Alvin Kamara. The Panthers\\' wariness of the Saints\\' ground game at that point was understandable, given that New Orleans had finished its first possession of the game with Latavius Murray\\'s 26-yard TD run. Payton risked losing challenges for the rest of the game when he dropped the red flag after the muffed punt. Earlier, he challenged an offensive pass interference penalty called against Saints tight end Jared Cook on a big gain. Officials declined to overturn that call. Also on that play, left tackle Terron Armstead received treatment on the field for an apparent leg injury, then walked off gingerly before being carted to the locker room. Carolina quickly responded to the Saints\\' second score with a TD of their own on a 51-yard pass from Kyle Allen to DJ Moore that made it 14-6. — Brett Martel reporting from New Orleans. Cleveland Browns owner Dee Haslam is showing her support for suspended defensive star Myles Garrett. Haslam wore a stocking cap bearing Garrett\\'s No. 95 while on the sideline during pregame warmups. Garrett was suspended indefinitely by the NFL for ripping off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph\\'s helmet and hitting him over the head with it. The suspension was upheld Thursday by an appeals officer. Garrett will miss Cleveland\\'s final six games and the playoffs, should the 4-6 Browns make them. Team officials are hoping he can return in 2020. Garrett is required to meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell\\'s office before he can be reinstated. The league fined Garrett $45,623 for his actions in the final seconds of Cleveland\\'s 21-7 win on Nov. 14. Thirty-two other players — 21 Steelers and 11 Browns — were disciplined for their involvement in the brawl. The Browns visit the Steelers next Sunday. — Tom Withers reporting from Cleveland. The Cincinnati Bengals have had some awful teams in their half-century of existence. The 2019 version is on the verge of one ugly franchise record. If the Bengals fall to their archrivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, on Sunday at Paul Brown Stadium, they will drop to 0-11, the only winless team in the NFL. The Bengals have matched their worst start in club history and longest losing streak. Cincinnati has dropped 12 straight overall from last season, a club mark, and 17 of 18, the worst such stretch in its history. The Steelers have won nine straight in the series, 12 of 13 and 17 of 20, including a first-round playoff win at Cincinnati in 2015 season. These Bengals, under first-year coach, Zac Taylor, can only dream of postseason appearances. They have the worst overall defense and worst rushing defense in the NFL.

Salt Lake City police said the package turned out to be a toolbox, and the Jazz said employees were cleared by authorities to re-enter the building a couple of hours after the evacuation. Most fans had already exited Vivint Smart Home Arena following Utah\\'s 113-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors when players, coaches and reporters were instructed to leave immediately. Not long after both coaches finished answering postgame questions from the media, a spokesman for the Jazz told reporters to exit the building due to the suspicious package. Outside, they were directed by security to leave the premises. Utah players quickly headed for their cars in the parking lot — center Rudy Gobert was still in uniform as he left. Warriors players boarded their team bus. Salt Lake City police Lt. Carlos Valencia said he received a call about the package from an officer working part-time at the game around 9:30 p.m. Valencia said the suspicious package looked like a shoebox and was discovered under a table behind a restaurant in the northeast corner of the arena. \"With that information, my next step was to call the bomb squad to have them come out, secure, and render the suspicious package safe,\" he said. \"From what I was told by the officers, was that the arena K-9 bomb dogs got a hit on the package. By the time I arrived, they had already secured the area\". Valencia said the sellout crowd was already starting to leave when the evacuation began. \"We wanted to take all precautions necessary because public safety is paramount to us,\" he said. In a statement, the Jazz said Salt Lake City police issued an \"all-clear\" at 11:32 p.m., and employees were permitted to re-enter the building to prepare for Saturday night\\'s Jazz home game. \"Guest safety is the top priority at Vivint Smart Home Arena. At the conclusion of the Utah Jazz-Golden State game, an employee noticed an unattended package on the main concourse. Upon further examination, it was concluded that we would enact our emergency action plan. Security was promptly alerted and guests were diverted away from the area and cleared from the arena. Salt Lake City Police Department assumed control of the situation, executing its suspicious package protocol,\" the Jazz said. \"We would like to thank fans for their attention and cooperation, as well as the Salt Lake City Police Department for their responsiveness and partnership\".

The 2019 version is on the verge of one ugly franchise record. If the Bengals fall to their archrivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, on Sunday at Paul Brown Stadium, they will drop to 0-11, the only winless team in the NFL. The Bengals have matched their worst start in club history and longest losing streak. Cincinnati has dropped 12 straight overall from last season, a club mark, and 17 of 18, the worst such stretch in its history. The Steelers have won nine straight in the series, 12 of 13 and 17 of 20, including a first-round playoff win at Cincinnati in 2015 season. These Bengals, under first-year coach, Zac Taylor, can only dream of postseason appearances. They have the worst overall defense and worst rushing defense in the NFL.

The four-year-old fashion label Clandestina on Friday night debuted a new collection, based on Cuba\\'s legacy of international athletic achievement, in the Ramon Fonst arena in Havana\\'s Revolution Plaza, home to the most powerful Cuban state institutions. Runway models included stars from the glory days of Cuban amateur sports, including world record high jumper Javier Sotomayor, Olympic champion runner Ana Fidelia Quirot and Regla Torres, considered by many to be the best female volleyball player in history. The Cuban private sector is legal but highly restricted by law, thickets of bureaucracy and official views of private enterprise as either a necessary evil, a potential threat to the socialist system, or both. Despite that, Clandestina was able to win permission to debut its 2020 \"Glories of Sports\" collection in the 4,000-seat Fonst arena, with the participation of athletes seen as national heroes, in a sign that at least some members of Cuban officialdom are increasingly accepting the legitimacy of private enterprise. Admission to the public was free. \"This couldn\\'t have been done in the past in Cuba,\" said Clandestina designer Gabriel Lara. \"This is all a process that comes out of entrepreneurship in Cuba and this today is very favorable for us and for our customers. This, today, is an advance\". Cuban first lady Lis Cuesta has become a quiet, high-profile promoter of Cuba\\'s private sector. When Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, visited Cuba, Cuesta hosted a tasting of offers from private restaurants. During a visit by the Spanish royal family this month, she wore a dress made by Dador, another small, private Cuban fashion label. The Clandestina collection\\'s theme appeared wisely chosen — pride in the nation\\'s sports glory is common to virtually all Cubans regardless of their attitudes toward the government or political beliefs. \"Even though they\\'re a private business, they\\'re doing work that shows our nation\\'s dignity and being private or state-run isn\\'t relevant,\" Quirós said. \"It doesn\\'t matter. They represent Cuba and the Cuban people\". Associated Press Correspondent Andrea Rodríguez contributed to this report.SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Aaron Rodgers dropped back on his first third down of the day, tried to avoid the pressure and got stripped on a sack that set up an early San Francisco touchdown and set the tone for the game for the Green Bay Packers. A matchup between two of the NFC\\'s top teams was a complete mismatch in large part because San Francisco\\'s stellar defense forced Rodgers into one of the worst performances of his career. Rodgers was held to 104 yards passing in the least efficient game of his career and the Packers went on to lose 37-8 to the 49ers on Sunday night in a performance that left Green Bay searching for answers. \"There wasn\\'t a whole lot positive tonight,\" Rodgers said. \"A lot of the stuff we talked about during the week, eliminating negative yardage plays, obviously we didn\\'t do that. They got after us up front, and the coverage was good on the back end\". The game started with the strip sack by Fred Warner that led to a recovery by Nick Bosa at the 2 and a touchdown run by Tevin Coleman and didn\\'t get much better after that for the Packers (8-3). They fell into a 23-0 hole at halftime, allowed a 61-yard touchdown pass from Jimmy Garoppolo to George Kittle two plays after scoring their only touchdown and put up anemic numbers on the night. Rodgers finished 20 for 33 for 104 yards, posting his lowest yards per attempt in his career. He was sacked five times, went 0 for 8 on passes that went at least 10 yards downfield and failed to convert any of the 13 third-down tries when he was in the game. The loss dropped the Packers into a tie for first place with Minnesota in the NFC North. \"We got outcoached and we got outplayed, and we\\'ve got to man up,\" coach Matt LaFleur said. \"We\\'ve got to look at ourselves critically and get a lot of stuff corrected, and we\\'ve got to be honest with ourselves. It wasn\\'t nearly good enough\". After the turnover on the opening drive, the Packers went three-and-out their next three possessions. They were stopped on a fourth-and-1 run by Aaron Jones on the next drive of the game and punted three more times to end the first half, gaining only one first down on those three possessions. \"We hurt ourselves again,\" receiver Davante Adams said. \"We just keep putting ourselves in these tough positions. When it\\'s third-and-forever or second-and-forever, it\\'s tough to comeback against a good team like that. We just have to put ourselves in a better position in early downs. That\\'ll be a start and then the rest you still have to execute, but you definitely put yourself in a terrible spot when it\\'s second-and-20 or second-and-whatever because of holding or jumping offsides or just not moving the sticks. We have to be better there\". When the Packers finally got something going offensively with a TD drive taking 8:34 in the third quarter on Rodgers\\' 2-yard pass to Adams, things quickly fell apart defensively with the blown coverage on Kittle\\'s long touchdown. It was all part of a forgettable night for Green Bay. \"I think every loss is a test,\" Rodgers said. \"We have leadership in this locker room. It kind of surfaced there in some postgame remarks by some of the guys. I\\'m not going to get into who said what, but it was definitely encouraging hearing some of those voices. I feel good about our culture, but we have to improve on offense and set the tone a little bit better than we did. Obviously I fumbled on the first drive and gave them seven. We just didn\\'t get anything going\". More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — With the richest prize in women\\'s golf history riding on the outcome, Sei Young Kim delivered the ultimate money putt. Even if she didn\\'t even know the score. Kim was tied for the lead going to the final hole Sunday at the CME Group Tour Championship. The nerves were obvious as she missed each of four straight putts from 12 feet or closer. Moments later, the 26-year-old South Korean took her place in LPGA Tour history. Kim made the putt of her life, a 25-footer for birdie that broke sharply to the right and into the cup for a 2-under 70, a one-shot victory over hard-charging Charley Hull and a $1.5 million payoff. \"It means a lot to me just knowing that I won the biggest purse in women\\'s golf history,\" said Kim, whose wire-to-wire win was her third of the year. \"That itself is an incredible honor\". Hull made her earn it. Six shots behind going to the back nine at Tiburon Golf Club, Hull birdied five of her last seven holes, including the last three. Her 12-foot birdie on the 18th gave her a 66 and a share of the lead. This was right after Danielle Kang made a 30-foot eagle putt on the par-5 17th and came inches short of a closing birdie to tie. Kim was fully aware of the pressure she felt. \"I was really nervous while walking through hole 18,\" she said. \"I was like: \\'OK, not a big deal. Try to play like a practice round,\\' thinking that would make me comfortable. Even then, I was really nervous\". She just was oblivious to her competition. All day, Kim thought it was Nelly Korda, who started one shot behind and fell back with a pair of costly drives to the left. From the top of a crown at the back of the green, Kim figured a two-putt would be enough. The crowd cheered. She pumped her fist and fought back tears. Only later, she said, did she realize what it meant. \"After I made it, I saw the leaderboard,\" she said. \"I didn\\'t know that Charley finished at 17 (under). What if I didn\\'t make it? We would have gone to a playoff and that wouldn\\'t have been good for me. So, wow!\". Wow, indeed. Kim won for the 10th time in her LPGA career, joining Se Ri Pak (25), Inbee Park (19) and Jiyai Shin (11) as South Korean players with at least 10 victories. This was memorable for the finish — and the prize. Instead of a $500,000 first-place check and a $1 million bonus to a season points race, CME Globe wanted to award $1.5 million in official money to any of the 60 players who qualified for the season finale. That\\'s $500,000 more than the previous record prize, $1 million at the U.S. Women\\'s Open. Kim finished at 18-under 270 and was No. 2 on the LPGA money list behind Jin Young Ko, who tied for 11th and still had no complaints about her season. Besides the money title, Ko won LPGA player of the year and the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average. She won four times this year, including two majors. Hull was an example of how the format change turned the Tour Championship into a free-for-all. She had only one top-10 finish this year and was No. 51 in the Race to CME Globe. A year ago, she wouldn\\'t have been eligible for the $1 million bonus. \"I gave it my best shot,\" said Hull, who won $480,000 for being runner-up. She made $405,961 in her previous 21 events this year. Korda, the highest-ranked American who had a chance to get to No. 2 in the world with a victory, tied for the lead with a birdie on the fourth hole. But she began to fall back by failing to birdie the par-5 sixth, scrambling for bogey on No. 9 and making a careless bogey on the 11th that put her three shots behind. On both par 5s on the back nine, she hit tee shots well left, leading to bogey at No. She birdied the last hole for a 71 to tie for third with Kang. Brooke Henderson shot 67 and finished alone in fifth. Korda also had a great view of a putt that was worth $1.5 million — a difference of $1.02 million between winning and second. \"To win $1.5 million by making that putt is quite amazing,\" Korda said. \"She had to make that birdie to win. It was an amazing cap off to the season\".A week after Colin Kaepernick\\'s NFL workout fell apart, disagreements and distrust about it remain on issues such as its timing, who was invited and who could film the quarterback. In conversations with The Associated Press, representatives from both sides blamed each other for what went wrong on Nov. 16. Kaepernick\\'s side said the NFL orchestrated a workout as a public relations stunt destined to fail, while the league said it gave him a real chance to show off his skills — and he didn\\'t show up. A total of 25 teams were supposed to attend the league\\'s workout run by two former head coaches at the Atlanta Falcons\\' practice facility. Instead, Kaepernick ditched that workout and ended up throwing passes in front of representatives from eight NFL teams at his own event at a site 60 miles away. Kaepernick, who led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl seven years ago, hasn\\'t played since 2016 when he sparked a wave of protests and divisive debate by kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The league in February settled a collusion grievance filed by Kaepernick and Eric Reid. The AP reviewed both waivers from the event and talked to a person who was involved in the negotiations from Kaepernick\\'s side and two NFL officials with knowledge of the process, all speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions between the two sides were private. A look at the issues raised by both sides regarding the botched workout:. DEADLINE TO ACCEPT. Kaepernick\\'s camp said the NFL gave him only two hours to accept an invitation four days ahead of the workout. His side questioned the timing, purpose and motivation behind a take-it-or-leave-it offer presented in Week 11. They believe the NFL cared more about creating the impression it wanted to give Kaepernick a chance for a new job than actually giving him a legitimate opportunity. The NFL said it was Commissioner Roger Goodell\\'s idea to give Kaepernick a platform for an unprecedented workout. The league, which hasn\\'t arranged tryouts for other free agents, said Goodell felt it was right to give the exiled QB the chance to showcase his skills. Teams were expressing interest in knowing whether Kaepernick was serious about playing. Kaepernick posted on social media that he was working out five days a week and ready to play again. Goodell spoke to other league officials and people outside the organization and decided an open tryout would give teams an opportunity to see for themselves. Jay-Z, who is in a partnership with the NFL, was involved in the conversations. Goodell also spoke to Dr. Harry Edwards, a civil rights activist. SATURDAY INSTEAD OF TUESDAY. Kaepernick\\'s side requested to move the workout to a Tuesday when most teams bring free agents in for tryouts. It was concerned that team \"decision-makers\" wouldn\\'t be present on a weekend. The NFL said coaches wouldn\\'t travel on a Tuesday or any other day during game week to see a free agent. It also said general managers rely on their scouts to evaluate free agents. The league says it didn\\'t want to push the date back because it \"did not want a circus\". The league pointed out that free agents are usually given a call one day before a workout, \"don\\'t bring in their own receivers, dictate the order of the workout, bring in their own media crew or have media onsite\". CLOSED TO MEDIA. Kaepernick\\'s side wanted to open the workout to the media to ensure transparency. The NFL said it made clear from the start the workout would be closed to media. The league wasn\\'t comfortable opening Atlanta\\'s practice facility to media and says it wanted to give Kaepernick \"the best platform from which to perform,\" and having camera crews present wouldn\\'t help him concentrate on the workout. It said the issue of media presence didn\\'t come up until the day of the scheduled workout. Kaepernick\\'s camp said the NFL agreed to provide a list of team representatives who committed to coming. The league later shifted and did not share that list. The league said it never made that promise because it didn\\'t want individual team personnel to face media questions leading up to the workout. Kaepernick\\'s team said he didn\\'t know which receivers he\\'d be throwing to and what routes they would run, so he brought in his own guys. He also wasn\\'t immediately informed that former Browns coach Hue Jackson would run the workout along with former Dolphins coach Joe Philbin. The NFL said it understood those concerns and addressed them to Kaepernick\\'s satisfaction. It said it even complied with Kaepernick\\'s request on the morning of the workout to change the order of events and begin with a throwing session instead of Jackson\\'s original plan to start with the interview portion. NIKE\\'S ROLE. The NFL said it agreed to Nike\\'s request to shoot an ad featuring Kaepernick and mentioning all the teams present at the workout. The league said the ad was supposed to be a social post featuring handwritten notes by a young Kaepernick that said he wanted to be a football player when he grew up. A spokesman for Nike said the company did not have a film crew at the workout and declined further comment. THE FILM CREW. Kaepernick\\'s side wanted to bring their own film crew because they didn\\'t trust that the NFL would provide accurate video and were concerned the league would edit it to make him look bad. The NFL said it invited Kaepernick\\'s representatives to sit in with the Falcons\\' video director at the facility to ensure the crew was capturing all the footage. The league said it planned to send the raw video to all 32 teams. Kaepernick\\'s representatives said the NFL \"demanded\" as a precondition for the workout that he sign an \"unusual liability waiver\" that addressed employment-related issues. They countered with a waiver from physical injury that the league rejected. The NFL said it sent Kaepernick a standard liability waiver based on the one used by National Invitational Camp at all NFL Combines and by teams when trying out free agents. Kaepernick signed a waiver with similar language before attending the combine in 2011. The NFL said it became concerned when Kaepernick\\'s side wanted to know who would own commercial rights to the video, adding that such an issue is not part of a typical workout. Kaepernick\\'s side says it was concerned that not only did the NFL document seek to waive employment rights, but it contained a clause that would give the NFL and its teams commercials rights to the workout footage that could be used for what it called \"phony\" public service announcements and other \"NFL marketing gimmicks\". The waiver provided by Kaepernick\\'s camp did not grant the commercial rights to anyone. The NFL disputes the interpretation of the clause, saying it was intended to enable the video to be sent to the clubs for evaluation with no marketing or commercial use. The league says it provided the waiver on Wednesday, didn\\'t hear back on it until Friday night, and didn\\'t receive a revised waiver until 12:03 p.m. on the day of the workout. Kaepernick\\'s side believes the NFL was using the workout as a PR stunt and wanted to avoid the NFL using the footage \"for its marketing and propaganda since the NFL waiver included a clause granting it these rights\". The NFL said it accommodated all of Kaepernick\\'s football requests, but nonfootball issues derailed it. The league said it would have invited the NFL Network to broadcast the workout if it wanted publicity.

He was, however, quick to note the importance of the victory. \"This is a big win. There\\'s no question about that,\" Carlisle said. \"You come in here, this is a big-time place to play and you\\'re playing against great players. So our guys deserve credit but this is a process and it\\'s day by day and week by week and we\\'ve got to continue to go for daily improvement\". Luka Doncic scored 41 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. added a season-high 31 and the Mavericks never trailed in the 137-123 romp. The Mavericks scored 45 points in the first quarter and were up 78-60 at halftime. Hardaway had 19 in the half, Doncic 17 and Kristaps Porzingis 15. \"That first quarter killed us,\" Houston\\'s P.J. James Harden was asked what Houston did wrong defensively. \"Everything,\" he said. \"We allowed them to do whatever they wanted to do from the beginning of the game and when you give a team like that comfort. they gain confidence. And that\\'s what they did\". The Mavericks has won five straight, scoring at least 137 in the last three. Houston has lost three straight after winning eight in a row. Dallas knew that the Rockets had a quick turnaround after playing a game in Los Angeles on Friday night and focused on getting off to a good start. \"It was important,\" Hardaway said. \"We wanted to make sure we came out of the gate with some firepower, some energy\". The Mavericks got a dunk from Dwight Powell to push the lead to 11 early in the fourth quarter. Houston used a 6-0 run after that shot to get to 110-105 with 9 minutes to go. Doncic ended the run with a jump shot, but Russell Westbrook added a basket seconds later to cut it to five again. Dallas was still up by 5 later in the quarter before scoring the next five points, with a dunk from Hardaway, to make it 119-109 midway through period, and Houston didn\\'t get close again. James Harden had 32 points for Houston but was just 2 of 15 on 3-pointers in a game where the Rockets made 10 of 44 3-point attempts. The Mavericks had extended the lead to 16 later in the fourth when Doncic scored six points in a row, capped by a 3-pointer to make it 132-113 with about 3 1/2 minutes to go. Dallas led by 20 in the third quarter before Houston scored the next seven points, with a 3-pointer from Tucker, to get to 89-76 midway through the period. The Mavericks were up by 16 later in the third after two free throws by Dorian Finney-Smith before Tucker made consecutive baskets to cut the lead to 103-91. Harden added two free throws, but Hardaway made a jump shot seconds later to make it 105-93. Westbrook made a basket to wrap up the third quarter and cut the lead to 10 entering the fourth. Mavericks: Seth Curry was back after sitting out the last game because of an illness. Porzingis finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds. Doncic had 10 assists and six rebounds. Doncic and Hardaway made five 3-pointers each. Rockets: House returned after missing the last game with a sore left shoulder. Clint Capela had 21 points and 22 rebounds. Westbrook scored 27 points with six assists and five rebounds. HARDAWAY\\'S HEALTH.

(AP) — Few teams have had success scoring touchdowns against the Patriots this season. Add the NFL\\'s top-ranked offense to that list. The Patriots held the Cowboys without a TD for the first time this season, Tom Brady threw a touchdown pass and New England beat Dallas 13-9 on Sunday. It was New England\\'s 18th straight regular-season victory at home. The Patriots (10-1) have won 10 games in 17 consecutive seasons dating back to 2003 and surpassed the San Francisco 49ers (16 seasons from 1983-98) for the most consecutive years with at least 10 wins. Dallas (6-5) had a chance to take the lead late. But facing fourth-and-11 on its own 25 with 1:50 left, Dak Prescott\\'s 20-yard completion to Amari Cooper was nullified after an official review. The Patriots, who struggled offensively in their win over Philadelphia last week, played without two key receivers after Mohamed Sanu and Phillip Dorsett were ruled out with injuries. Brady made the most of what he had, tossing a first-quarter touchdown pass to rookie N\\'Keal Harry and completing a 32-yard pass to rookie Jakobi Meyers. Brady finished 17 of 37 for 190 yards. Julian Edelman caught eight passes for 93 yards. Sony Michel rushed 20 times for 85 yards. Brady has been critical of the offense\\'s output in recent weeks. Coming away with wins is enough for him right now. \"I think every team develops at different times,\" Brady said. \"I think we take the challenges as they come and try to do the best we can. I\\'m happy we came away with more points than them\". Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said the wet and windy conditions on the field, which included temperatures that dipped into the 30s, played a factor. \"Obviously no excuses. But the weather had an impact on both offenses,\" he said. \"A lot of balls on the ground, a lot of balls going off receivers\\' hands. I thought our guys handled it better and better as the game went on\". But not well enough. Dallas struggled to move the ball for most of the game. Ezekiel Elliott rushed 21 times or 86 yards, but the Cowboys were just 2 of 13 on third down. Prescott finished 19 of 33 for 212 yards and an interception. Cooper was held without a catch for the first time as a member of the Cowboys. Dallas entered the game averaging 444.6 yards per game on offense and had the league\\'s best passing attack, averaging 312.7 yards. But the Cowboys looked pedestrian for most of the first half opposite New England\\'s top-ranked defense, which came in allowing just 152.6 passing yards. The Patriots focused on taking away two of Prescott\\'s favorite targets in Cooper and tight end Jason Witten. Prescott threw in their direction just twice in the opening half, while mostly checking down to short passes. Elliott helped the Cowboys keep the ball moving, but his long gains were limited as New England stacked the box on first and second down. \"It was frustrating,\" Elliott said. \"Just gotta find a way to score\". Dallas finally found some traction trailing 13-6 in the fourth quarter when Prescott connected with Randall Cobb for a 59-yard gain to get the Cowboys to the New England 25. The drive stalled on the Patriots 11 and the Cowboys settled for a 29-yard field goal by Brett Maher. New England got help from a special teams play to set up Harry\\'s TD. Matt Slater blocked Chris Jones\\' punt on the Dallas 30, and Nate Ebner recovered on the 12. Two plays later, Brady hit Harry in the front of the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown — the first of Harry\\'s NFL career. \"I\\'m definitely not satisfied yet,\" Harry said. \"Anybody who knows me knows I\\'m about to turn it up a notch. To set the bar higher. I\\'m ready to get back to work\". Prescott was intercepted by Stephon Gilmore on Dallas\\' ensuring drive. The Patriots took over on the Dallas 29, but quickly went three-and-out. They settled for a 44-yard field goal by Nick Folk that made it 10-0. Harry became the 75th player to catch a touchdown pass from Brady, extending an NFL record. Vinny Testaverde was second, with 70 different TD targets. A first-round draft choice from Arizona State, Harry made his debut last week after spending time on injured reserve with an ankle injury. It was the 15th touchdown pass of the season for Brady. That\\'s a record for a player after his 42nd birthday. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he was frustrated the team didn\\'t perform better on a day it had a chance to gain some distance in the NFC East. \"Make no mistake: This was a bigger game for us than it is for the Patriots,\" he told reporters in a lengthy session in an equipment closet off the visitors\\' locker room. \"We had a chance to establish something. I\\'m just frustrated. I thought we could put together a better effort\". Jones said he got what he expected out of the defense and seemed willing to give the offense a bit of a pass because of the foul weather. But the special teams came under scrutiny for allowing a blocked punt, missing a field goal and blowing 20 yards of field position with a penalty on another punt. \"Special teams is 100 percent coaching,\" he said.

No thanks to the offense. 4 Bulldogs managed only one touchdown Saturday, but Rodrigo Blankenship booted four field goals and the defense stymied 24th-ranked Texas A&M for a lackluster 19-13 victory. Georgia (10-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference, No. 4 CFP) wrapped up the league schedule with its fifth straight victory, but it was a struggle all the way. On a wet day between the hedges, the Bulldogs managed only 260 total yards and didn\\'t really seal the victory until D\\'Andre Swift broke off an 11-yard run on third-and-1 with 2 1/2 minutes remaining. \"No bones about it, we\\'ve got to improve,\" coach Kirby Smart said. \"There were things tonight that we missed that were there. That\\'s the frustrating part\". While the Bulldogs struggled offensively, the defense turned in another dominating performance until the closing minutes, when fatigue set in and the unit had to get by without top cornerback Eric Stokes, who left with an undisclosed injury. His backup, freshman Tyrique Stevenson, knocked away a pass that forced the Aggies to punt with 4:21 remaining. They never got it back. \"Those guys are relentless,\" said Georgia quarterback Jake Fromm, who had another tough game. \"I\\'m really thankful they\\'re on our team\". Texas A&M (7-4, 4-3) was held to just minus-1 yards rushing and 274 yards overall, one week after piling up 319 yards on the ground in a rout of South Carolina. In his final game at Sanford Stadium, Blankenship connected on field goals of 41, 49, 37 and 31 yards to become Georgia\\'s career scoring leader with 418 points. He passed Marshall Morgan (407), Billy Bennett (409) and previous leader Blair Walsh (412). \"The history of great kickers that Georgia\\'s had,\" said Blankenship, who gained notoriety for his thick goggles but will be remembered for his uncanny accuracy. \"Just to be among the ranks of those guys is really an honor\". Blankenship\\'s performance was especially impressive in the sloppy conditions. His 49-yarder came when the rain was at its heaviest. \"It was straight down the middle,\" teammate Richard LeCounte marveled. \"That\\'s special\". Athens was hit by storms before the game, and another line rolled through in the second quarter, keeping famed mascot Uga X confined to his doghouse. Then, suddenly, the showers cleared. So did the cloud over the Georgia offense. Just after sun broke through the clouds, bathing the towering north stands in light, freshman George Pickens slipped free down the right sideline and hauled in a 16-yard pass from Fromm, pushing the Bulldogs to a 13-3 lead at halftime. It would be Georgia\\'s only trip to the end zone. The Bulldogs kept settling for field goals, and Texas A&M finally produced its lone TD of the game. Going 75 yards in 10 plays, the Aggies scored on Kellen Mond\\'s 19-yard touchdown pass to Jhamon Ausbon with 11:16 remaining. They got no closer. \"I think we showed a lot of guts,\" coach Jimbo Fisher said. \"Unfortunately, there are no moral victories. We\\'re not here for moral victories. We played a great football team very well, but we\\'ve got to find that last 2 inches at the top of the mountain\". FROMM VS SWIFT. Georgia\\'s offensive frustration was epitomized when Fromm failed to audible out of a blitz in the closing minutes and Swift was thrown for a 2-yard loss. The cameras caught Swift yelling at his quarterback, though everyone shrugged off the incident after the game. \"That\\'s just two competitors who want to compete,\" Fromm said. Added Swift: \"We\\'re always cool. That\\'s football. Nothing is ever going to come between us\". What someone asked Smart about the dust-up between two of his biggest stars, the coach said, \"It wasn\\'t a dust-up. That\\'s love. That\\'s passion. It was a situation where we were milking the clock, and A&M disguised a blitz and Jake didn\\'t get out of it\". Texas A&M: The Aggies had another chance to prove they can compete with the nation\\'s top teams. Again, they came up short. All four of their losses have been to teams that were ranked in the Top 10 at the time of the game. Georgia: It\\'s difficult to envision the Bulldogs reaching the four-team playoff with the way their offense is playing. Fromm\\'s struggles are especially concerning. The junior quarterback was 11 of 23 for 163 yards, the third straight game he has failed to complete even 50 percent of his passes. But Swift had some very impressive runs, finishing with 103 yards on 19 carries. Overall, however, the Bulldogs were held to a season-low 97 yards rushing. Texas A&M: Completes its season-ending gauntlet by traveling to Baton Rouge to take on No. 1 LSU — the fifth Top 10 opponent the Aggies have faced this season. Georgia: Makes the short trip to Atlanta for its \"Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate\" rivalry game against Georgia Tech (3-8) to end the regular season. The Bulldogs will be heavily favored to beat the Yellow Jackets for the third year in a row and 16th time in their last 19 meetings.

More AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — When it comes time to set the College Football Playoff field, the difference between No. 1 and No. 2 could be enormous. About as large as the distance between Clemson, South Carolina, and Salt Lake City. With a chance to make a statement that it belonged atop the rankings, Ohio State caught a case of fumbilitis and let No. 9 Penn State hang around on a wet Saturday at the Horseshoe. Pushed for the first time this season, the second-ranked Buckeyes (10-0, No. 2 CFP) responded and comfortably put the Nittany Lions away without scoring a fourth-quarter point. \"Having this slugfest under our belt is going to be good for us in the long run,\" Buckeyes center Josh Myers said. Yes, it should help the Buckeyes to be battle-tested against Michigan next week and in the Big Ten championship next month. Even more so, it could help them if/when they reach the playoff. But in the beauty pageant that is the playoff selection process, the Buckeyes\\' victory might not have been pretty enough to convince the committee they should be No. There is still time to change hearts and minds. Heck, there is still plenty of time for Ohio State to play itself right out of the playoff. But right now, LSU owns the top seed based mostly on resume (wins over Alabama, Florida and Auburn. Side note: That victory at Texas is not aging quite so well) and unbeaten Clemson is third. The Buckeyes can now add Penn State to victories against ranked teams Cincinnati and Wisconsin. Each of their games this season has been decided by double-digits. The Tigers, Buckeyes and Tigers are all firmly in control of their path to the postseason. Without a chance to beat any highly ranked opponents, Clemson looks locked into No. 3 with LSU and Ohio State competing for No. The fourth spot? If form holds, that could be Alabama without Tua Tagovailoa. 7 Utah, as a one-loss Pac-12 champion. Maybe Oklahoma or Baylor out of the Big 12. All of those would be a preferable matchup to facing Clemson. Rag on the strength of the Atlantic Coast Conference all you want. It is deserved. But Clemson is still a monster, with Trevor Lawrence looking more and more like the player who cut up Notre Dame and Alabama in the playoff last year. If finishing No. 1 means avoiding the defending national champions, then finishing No. 1 is a big deal. The Buckeyes can still make the case they are a more complete team than LSU. Saturday\\'s game flipped on three lost fumbles by the Buckeyes. One by Justin Fields right before he dove across the goal line kept Ohio State from going up 14-0 after two possessions. After going up 21-0 in the third quarter, things got dicey. Two more Ohio State fumbles deep in its own territory led to 10 points, and just like that it was 21-17. The Buckeyes restored order with a touchdown and then smothered Penn State behind another Heisman-worthy performance by Chase Young. The junior defensive end returned from two-game suspension for an NCAA violation that occurred last year and had three more sacks. Ohio State has both an elite offense and an elite defense; LSU has just the former. Ohio State-Penn State felt a little like LSU-Auburn, won 23-20 by LSU. In both cases, the winning team outgained the loser big and mostly controlled the game, but some miscues kept it close. Ohio State can still add a road win against Michigan and either Minnesota or Wisconsin to its list of impressive victories. LSU gets Texas A&M next week and an SEC championship game against Georgia, which beat A&M but continues to show no signs of having an offense that can keep up with the Tigers. Nothing is guaranteed for the Buckeyes and Bulldogs, but style points might count, too. \"This was hard today,\" Ohio State coach Ryan Day. \"We learned some lessons and hopefully we can go from there\". The Pac-12 was just four victories away, two by Oregon and two by Utah, from setting up what would have been its most interesting conference championship since the league started playing the game in 2011. Two 11-1 teams with a chance to make the playoff. 6 Oregon\\'s offense disappeared for more the three quarters and by the time the Ducks and Justin Herbert found a groove, the defense broke down and Arizona State pulled off the upset. The Ducks already had the Pac-12 North locked up, but the loss ends their playoff hopes and hurts the Utes, too. Utah, trying to take care of its business Saturday night at Arizona, has been dominant but lacks high-value victories on its resumes. The Pac-12\\'s loss is the Big 12\\'s gain. Victories by Oklahoma and Baylor mean they are still on course for a battle of 11-1s in the conference title game. It was also a good day for No. The committee has said it will be watching closely as the Tide face Auburn next week with backup quarterback Mac Jones. AROUND THE COUNTRY: Baylor made it back before Texas. The Bears pounded the Longhorns, clinching a spot in the Big 12 championship game and snapping a four-game losing streak to Texas. In coach Tom Herman\\'s third season in Austin, the Longhorns need to beat Texas Tech next week to avoid a 6-6 regular season. Meanwhile, Matt Rhule took over a program demolished by scandal and has gone from 1-11 in Year 1 to playoff contender in Year 3. Maybe Texas hired the wrong American Athletic Conference coach in 2016? 12 Michigan will come rolling into the Ohio State on a four-game winning streak after handling Indiana and playing about as well as, well, as it was playing last year when the Wolverines were crushed by the Buckeyes in Columbus. Credit the Wolverines for turning around a season that was teetering after some ugly early performances. Though it\\'s doubtful many will credit coach Jim Harbaugh for anything if he loses to the Buckeyes again. But that\\'s his life right now. 15 Notre Dame is a victory away against a struggling Stanford team from its third double-digit victory season in a row under Brian Kelly. The Irish have never won on the Farm in nine seasons under Kelly, but now is as good a time as ever to break that streak. Stanford lost its rivalry game to California for the first time since 2009, eliminating the Cardinal from bowl contention and sending the Bears to the postseason. The Irish ripped Boston College to get to 9-2 and drop the Eagles to 5-6. They are in danger of missing the postseason for the first time since 2015, which could put coach Steve Addazio in a precarious spot. The Big Ten West championship game is set for next week in Minnesota, with the 11th-ranked Gophers facing No. 14 Wisconsin in a game that will likely draw ESPN\\'s \"College GameDay\" to the Twins Cities for the first time. The week after Badgers running back Jonathan Taylor became the first FBS player to have three 200-yard games in a career against the same team (Nebraska) he had his third career 200-yard rushing game against Purdue. Virginia Tech\\'s humiliating home loss to Duke seems like a million years ago. The Hokies posted their second straight shutout, in retiring defensive coordinator Bud Foster\\'s final home game, to set up a division title game against rival Virginia next week. Clay Helton might not be around to benefit, but whoever is coaching Southern California next season will have a quarterback to build around in Kedon Slovis. The freshman passed for 515 yards in a victory against UCLA. 18 Memphis needs to beat No. 17 Cincinnati next week at home and then do it again in the American Athletic Conference championship the following week to all but lock up a bid the Cotton Bowl.

(AP) — Tyler Duncan made a 12-foot putt on the second hole of a playoff with Webb Simpson on Sunday in the RSM Classic for his first PGA Tour title. Playing two groups ahead of Simpson in windy conditions on Sea Island\\'s Seaside Course, Duncan birdied three of the last four holes in regulation for a 5-under 65. He two-putted the par-5 15h for a birdie, made a 6-footer on the par-3 17th and a 25-footer on the par-4 18th. \"I\\'m just so happy to be here playing and to come out here and win is just unbelievable,\" Duncan said. Simpson birdied 15 and 16 and closed with two pars, making a 5-footer on 18 to match Duncan at 19-under 263. \"It played really tough all day,\" Simpson said. \"It was blowing it seemed like a solid 20 and gusts here and there, and the pins were tough. They did a good job of setup, but they didn\\'t make it easy for us. It was especially hard starting out the way we did, so I played really well given the conditions\". They played the 18th twice in the playoff, matching pars on the first extra hole. \"I was definitely nervous, yeah,\" Duncan said\". I\\'ve been working really hard on controlling my emotions and breathing and all that stuff and it paid off down the stretch here, especially this playoff. I was just able to keep calm and trust what I was doing\". Simpson has four top-seven finishes in eight starts in the event. \"I felt like it was going to go my way, but that\\'s what great players do, they birdie the last two holes like he did,\" Simpson said. \"So, tough to finish that way, but all in all, a great week\". The 30-year-old Duncan regained his PGA Tour card with a 12th-place finish in the Korn Ferry Tour Finals after finishing 163rd in the FedEx Cup standings. He shot a 61 on Friday, then made 18 pars in a 70 on Saturday that left him four strokes behind third-round leader Brendon Todd. \"I knew it was going to be a tough day out here,\" Duncan said. \"It was colder, the wind picked up and I was just trying to do the best I could, fight until the end. I hit one of the best 4-irons I\\'ve ever hit on 17 6 feet up the hill and you guys saw the probably 30-footer I made here on 18 just to get to a playoff\". He earned his first spots in the Masters, PGA Championship and Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. \"Just so many different things that I\\'m very, very excited for,\" Duncan said. Sebastian Munoz was a stroke back after a 68. The Colombian won the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi in September for his first PGA Tour title. \"First maybe eight holes I was a little tight,\" Munoz said. \"I was too careful with my speed. Then, I just kind of let it go and made a couple more putts and hit better shots and it was all good. I gave myself a chance on 18. It didn\\'t happen this time, but it already did this year, so I\\'m happy\". Todd, seeking his third straight PGA Tour victory, was fourth at 16 under after a 72. He took a two-stroke lead into the final round. \"I was definitely tired on the back nine,\" Todd said. \"With no momentum going, no birdies through 14 holes, it just seemed like I couldn\\'t summon the energy to make some birdies. \"I\\'m really appreciative of the last two wins that I just had in Bermuda and Mexico. Had another opportunity this week, but it didn\\'t go my way. Just trying to keep getting in contention and closing out\".

The NFL didn\\'t see any expansion in the decade, but a few franchises were on the move. The St. Louis Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016 after 21 seasons. A year later, the San Diego Chargers also returned to Los Angeles after 56 seasons, putting two teams in Hollywood. The Oakland Raiders announced they were moving to Las Vegas in 2020. The New England Patriots went to the Super Bowl five times, won three titles and played in the AFC championship game eight straight seasons. Their biggest victory came against Atlanta in February 2017. Led by NFL MVP Matt Ryan and an opportunistic defense, the Falcons stormed to a 21-0 lead and were up 28-3 with 18 minutes left in the game. But Tom Brady orchestrated the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history. He threw a pair of touchdown passes to get the Patriots within 28-20. After James White ran in from the 1 with 57 seconds remaining, Brady connected with Danny Amendola for the 2-point conversion. The Patriots won the coin toss in overtime. Brady completed five straight passes to the Falcons 25 and soon, White scampered into the end zone to cap the win and give Brady and coach Bill Belichick their fifth championship. New England\\'s bid to repeat fell short the following year against the Philadelphia Eagles. Backup quarterback Nick Foles, who replaced Carson Wentz after the second-year quarterback tore two knee ligaments in Week 14, threw three touchdown passes and caught one in a 41-33 victory that gave Philadelphia its first NFL championship since 1960. But the Patriots were back in the Big Game the next season against the high-powered Rams. The defense dominated Sean McVay\\'s offense, holding the Rams to a field goal in a 13-3 victory. Belichick joined George Halas and Curly Lambeau as the only coaches to win six NFL titles. Brady became the first player to win six rings. In 2016, Peyton Manning won his second Super Bowl title in his final game. Manning, at age 39, had the worst season of his career. He went from throwing 39 TDs and 15 interceptions to nine and 17, got hurt, lost his starting job to Brock Osweiler and regained it the final game of the season with the No. 1 seed on the line. Manning was more of a \"game manager\" in the playoffs, and Von Miller and Denver\\'s defense dominated Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. Peyton\\'s younger brother, Eli, won his second Super Bowl four years earlier. Eli Manning led the New York Giants to their second victory over Brady and the Patriots in February 2012. Seattle, Baltimore, Green Bay and New Orleans also won Super Bowls in the decade. Brady won a pair of NFL MVP awards, including his third one at age 40 following the 2017 season. He became the second player in the four major professional sports to win MVP at age 40; Barry Bonds won baseball\\'s award in 2004. By winning three more Super Bowls to become the first player with six rings, Brady staked claim to the title of greatest quarterback ever. He\\'s still going at age 42. Peyton Manning, at 37, was no youngster when he set NFL records with 5,477 yards passing and 55 TD passes in 2013. Manning earned his record fifth NFL MVP award and first with the Broncos. He made a remarkable recovery after missing the 2011 season following several neck surgeries, got released by Indianapolis and cemented his Pro Football Hall of Fame resume in Denver. Drew Brees also showed age doesn\\'t matter at the quarterback position. He broke Manning\\'s record for career yards passing and was third behind Manning and Brady in career TD passes. Brees, at 40, has the Saints in position to challenge for the Super Bowl this season. Adrian Peterson was the only non-quarterback to win an MVP award in the decade. He rebounded from a torn ACL and MCL suffered in December 2011, ran for 2,097 yards in 2012 and became the fourth running back to earn the honors this century. Other standout players in the decade include quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson, tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Jason Witten, and wide receivers Calvin Johnson, Antonio Brown and Julio Jones. On defense, J.J. Watt, Aaron Donald and Khalil Mack dominated. Belichick moved into the conversation for the greatest coach ever title, joining Halas and Lambeau as the only coaches to win six NFL championships. Pete Carroll returned to the NFL with the Seattle Seahawks in 2010, won one Super Bowl and came within a goal-line interception of back-to-back titles. Andy Reid left Philadelphia as the winningest coach in franchise history, went to Kansas City and turned the Chiefs into an instant winner. He led them to five playoff appearances in his first six seasons, drafted Patrick Mahomes and developed him into an NFL MVP in his second season. Mike Tomlin continued his run of success in Pittsburgh. Bruce Arians won the NFL Coach of the Year Award in Indianapolis as an interim, and later in Arizona, and aims for a third in Tampa Bay. Jon Gruden left a TV booth after nine years to return to Oakland for a $100 million, 10-year contract. Other coaches who made their mark in the 2010s include John Harbaugh, Doug Pederson and Ron Rivera. On Feb. 1, 2015, in the final minute the Seahawks were 1 yard away from winning consecutive Super Bowls. But on second down, Russell Wilson dropped back to pass instead of giving the ball to power back Marshawn Lynch. Malcolm Butler jumped in front of the pass and picked it to seal New England\\'s fourth Super Bowl title. On Feb. 5, 2017, Brady rallied the Patriots from that 25-point deficit against the Falcons to an overtime victory for their fifth ring. On Feb. 4, 2018, the \"Philly Special\" helped deny New England another title and gave Philadelphia a parade. On Jan. 8, 2012, Tim Tebow capped a season of incredible comebacks with one more, leading the Broncos to an overtime win over the Steelers by throwing an 80-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas on the first play in the extra period to send Denver to the divisional round. Tebow threw for 316 yards. The NFL made several game-altering rule changes this decade. In 2019, both offensive and defensive pass interference calls became reviewable by officiating crews on a one-year trial period. In 2018, the league simplified rules to clarify a catch. Many rules were implemented for player safety, including expansion of protection for defenseless players and elimination of hits with the crown of a helmet. Overtime rules were amended in 2017, shortening the period from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. In 2010, a rule was implemented to give both teams an opportunity to possess the ball — unless the team that receives the overtime kickoff scores a touchdown on its first possession. FUN FACT:. On Dec. 28, 2010, the Eagles and Vikings played the first Tuesday night game in the NFL since 1946. The game was scheduled for Sunday night, but the NFL moved it on game day before a blizzard dumped about a foot of snow on Philadelphia. Rookie quarterback Joe Webb, making his first career start filling in for the injured Brett Favre, led the 14-point underdog Vikings to an upset over Michael Vick and the NFC East champion Eagles. The loss cost Philadelphia a shot at a first-round bye in the playoffs. The Eagles ended up losing a wild-card game at home to Green Bay. More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.Jimmy Garoppolo and the San Francisco 49ers refuse to look too far ahead on their schedule. Especially this week while staring at a showdown with Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. The thing is, though, this matchup could go a long way in helping determine the teams\\' seeding when the playoffs start. So, this one Sunday night at Levi\\'s Stadium will have a bit of a postseason feel for both the 49ers (9-1) and Packers (8-2). \"With the (49ers) faithful and everything, having them helping out the defense and just getting the place rocking will be huge,\" Garoppolo said. \"The louder they can be, the better. But, yeah, it\\'ll be a big game Sunday. \"This is a great opportunity, great challenge for us\". It\\'s also the highlight of a Week 12 slate of games on the NFL schedule. San Francisco begins a three-game stretch against teams currently in first place — and all with 8-2 records — including Green Bay, Baltimore and New Orleans. \"I don\\'t even think about playoff seeding right now,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. \"Our goal is to get in the playoffs. We\\'re all right there. There\\'s still a lot of football left. Each game we win, we\\'ve got a better chance at getting in there. You don\\'t think about seeds, at least I don\\'t, until you can narrow it down to one or two games. I think we\\'re far from that right now\". The 49ers showed some resilience last week, rallying from 16 points down to beat Arizona for the team\\'s biggest regular-season comeback since 2011. Meanwhile, the Packers are coming off a 24-16 victory over Carolina at home, giving them five wins in their past six games. \"We\\'ve been finding a way to win, different ways,\" Rodgers said. \"I think great teams understand their roles and embrace them and make it more about the team\". And, Green Bay is no stranger to playing in front of big TV audiences: The Packers are 3-1 in prime-time games this season. Week 12 started with Houston\\'s 20-17 home victory over Indianapolis. Deshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes to DeAndre Hopkins and finished with 298 yards to help the Texans take the AFC South lead. Houston (7-4) rebounded from a 41-7 loss to Baltimore on Sunday. The Colts dropped to 6-5. Arizona (3-7-1), Minnesota (8-3), Kansas City (7-4) and the Los Angeles Chargers (4-7) are the final teams this season to take their bye-week breaks. BALTIMORE (8-2) at LOS ANGELES RAMS (6-4). Lamar Jackson and the Ravens play in LA on Monday night on a six-game winning streak, the longest active run in the NFL and the team\\'s best since 2000 — when they won Super Bowl. Baltimore has done it mostly in dominant fashion, too, having won four in a row by 14 points or more. Jared Goff and the Rams have won three of four to stay in the NFC playoff race. Los Angeles will also see a familiar face: Ravens cornerback Marcus Peters was acquired in a trade with the Rams on Oct. 15 and has returned two interceptions for touchdowns while with Baltimore. DALLAS (6-4) at NEW ENGLAND (9-1). The Cowboys have the NFL\\'s top-ranked offense, and the Patriots are ranked No. 1 in defense. So, something\\'s got to give, right. Dallas\\' Dak Prescott leads the league with 322.1 passing yards per game and is on pace to be the first Cowboys QB to top the NFL in yards passing for a full season. He also has 38 wins since entering the NFL in 2016, second most in the league during that span behind — yep, you guessed it: the Patriots\\' Tom Brady. With a win Sunday, New England would extend its streak to 17 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins — which would be an NFL record. SEATTLE (8-2) at PHILADELPHIA (5-5). This matchup is highlighted by streaking quarterbacks, with the Seahawks\\' Russell Wilson and Eagles\\' Carson Wentz each having thrown at least one touchdown pass in 13 consecutive regular-season games, the longest active run in the NFL. Wilson is looking to improve to 4-0 in his career against the Eagles. And, Seattle has been terrific on the road, going 5-0 so far away from home. Wentz and the Eagles are struggling on offense right now and are coming off a 17-10 loss to New England last week. CAROLINA (5-5) at NEW ORLEANS (8-2). Christian McCaffrey has been a huge bright spot in what has been an up-and-down season in Carolina. The Panthers running back is the first NFL player with at least 1,000 yards rushing and 500 yards receiving in his team\\'s first 10 games of season. He has also eclipsed 140 scrimmage yards in each of past four games — although Carolina is 1-3 in those. New Orleans also has a record-breaking star on offense in wide receiver Michael Thomas, who leads the league with 94 receptions, the most by a player in the first 10 games of a season in NFL history. He\\'s also the first player with 90-plus receptions in each of his first four seasons. JACKSONVILLE (4-6) at TENNESSEE (5-5). The Jaguars are looking to sweep the Titans for the first time since 2005 after Jacksonville made things miserable for then-Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was sacked nine times in the 20-7 loss in Week 3. Ryan Tannehill is under center this time around for the Titans and has three-game winning drives in four starts. He has also been solid at home, where he has a 100 or higher passer rating in three games. Nick Foles is Jacksonville\\'s quarterback for this meeting after Gardner Minshew played in his place while he sat out because of injury. Foles threw for 296 yards and two TDs with one interception in a 33-13 loss to Indianapolis, his first start since the opener. DENVER (3-7) at BUFFALO (7-3). The Bills are off to their best start after 10 games in 20 years, and the play of Josh Allen has been a big reason. Buffalo\\'s second-year quarterback earned AFC offensive player of week honors after going 21 of 33 for 256 yards and three touchdowns passing and one rushing in a 37-20 win over Miami. Allen also has 163 pass attempts without an interception, dating to a 14-7 win at Tennessee in Week 6. The Broncos have been deadly — to themselves — late in games, having squandered four fourth-quarter leads. The latest was a doozy as Denver became the first team in five years to blow a 20-point first-half lead in a 27-23 loss to Minnesota last Sunday. It all has John Elway\\'s Broncos in jeopardy of a second 3-8 record in three years. TAMPA BAY (3-7) at ATLANTA (3-7). The Falcons have won the past five meetings between the NFC South rivals, with the Buccaneers\\' previous victory coming over three years ago. Atlanta enters this matchup having won two in a row overall after starting the season 1-7. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay has lost five of its past six. What does it all mean? Well, the loser in this one will fall into sole possession of last place in the division. Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston leads the NFL with 22 turnovers, including a league-high 18 interceptions. He\\'ll face a Falcons defense that had four interceptions in a win over Carolina. OAKLAND (6-4) at NEW YORK JETS (3-7). The Raiders are coming off having swept a three-game homestand for the first time since 1980. Now, they hit the road, where they\\'re 1-3 this season. Oakland rookie running back Josh Jacobs has three 100-yard performances and ranks fourth in the NFL in rushing with 923 yards. He\\'ll face a tough test in this one against a Jets defense that is allowing a league-low 79.1 yards rushing per game. Sam Darnold and the Jets have won two in a row, coming against the lowly Giants and Redskins. Now, New York looks to win three straight for the first time since Weeks 3-5 of the 2017 season — yes, over two years ago. MIAMI (2-8) at CLEVELAND (4-6). Both teams welcome playing a game after a turbulent week for each. The Dolphins released suspended running back Mark Walton after his arrest on charges of punching his pregnant girlfriend. Meanwhile, the Browns are dealing with the fallout from Myles Garrett\\'s suspension for clobbering Pittsburgh\\'s Mason Rudolph with the quarterback\\'s helmet. Miami had its two-game winning streak end last week against Buffalo, and has been outscored by a league-worst 166 points while ranking last in turnover differential (minus-13) and takeaways (seven). Cleveland is creeping back toward the playoff picture after a slow start with two straight home wins. The Browns have helped themselves by not committing a turnover in their past three games. NEW YORK GIANTS (2-8) at CHICAGO (4-6). The Giants come off their bye-week break having dropped six straight and would clinch a third losing season in row with a loss. Saquon Barkley has struggled since returning from a high ankle sprain more than a month ago. Barkley has carried 64 times for 165 yards, an average of 2.57 yards, in four games against Arizona, Detroit, Dallas and the Jets — against whom he gained a career-worst 1 yard on 13 carries. Chicago has lost five of six, despite holding opponents under 20 points in three of the past four games. The problem has been on offense as the Bears rank 28th in scoring and 27th in touchdowns. DETROIT (3-6-1) at WASHINGTON (1-9). The Lions have dropped three in row for the third time under second-year coach Matt Patricia. It appears Detroit might have to try to snap the skid without quarterback Matthew Stafford, who\\'s expected to miss his third consecutive game with a back injury. So, it\\'s up to Jeff Driskel, who has three touchdowns and one interception this season in Stafford\\'s place. The Redskins have lost four in a row overall, and nine straight at home, dating to last season. Rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins, sacked six times last week against the Jets, is expected to make his third NFL start. PITTSBURGH (5-5) at CINCINNATI (0-10). The Steelers will be short-handed in this one as they\\'ll be without center Maurkice Pouncey, who\\'s serving a suspension for his role in the brawl at the end of Pittsburgh\\'s loss to Cleveland last week. Injured running back James Conner (shoulder) and wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (concussion/knee) are also expected to miss the game. The Steelers have this going for them: They\\'ve won nine straight in the series, 12 of 13 and 17 of 20. Oh, and there\\'s also the fact the Bengals are the only winless team in the NFL and have matched the worst start in club history and its longest losing streak. More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — After cruising through the first 10 games against teams that didn\\'t put up much a fight, No. 2 Ohio State found itself in a slugfest with No. 9 Penn State. The Buckeyes responded, winning with defense. Justin Hillard intercepted Penn State backup Will Levis\\' pass and the Buckeyes stopped the Nittany Lions on fourth down on two late drives to seal a 28-17 victory and lock up the Big Ten East title. J.K. Dobbins rushed for 157 yards and two touchdowns, and Justin Fields threw for 188 yards and two scores for Ohio State (10-0, 8-0). Ohio State held on after Penn State (9-2, 7-2) took advantage of two second-half turnovers to climb back in the game after trailing 21-0. This was a far different scenario for Ohio State, which hadn\\'t yet had to play hard into the second half. \"We talked about going into a big heavyweight match, and you have to take shots,\" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. \"One of the things about playing in a game like this is you have to be willing to take punches and you have to not flinch when it happens. That was a great example. That was the first time we really were taking shots there\". The Buckeyes were clinging to a 21-17 lead early in the fourth quarter when Fields threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave to create some breathing room. Ohio State, with Chase Young back from a two-game suspension, then got the interception from Hillard before shutting down two late Penn State drives on fourth down, aided by deafening crowd noise. The last drive included back-to-back sacks of backup quarterback Will Levis by Young and linebacker Baron Browning. FIELDS FIGHTS BACK. Fields fumbled away the ball twice, once as he was crossing the goal line for what would have been a touchdown. But he got critical yards on the ground, rushing for 68 yards on 21 carries and threw beautiful second half touchdown passes to K.J. Hill and Olave. And he got knocked around plenty, and at one point late in the game was slow to get up after being sacked but stayed in the game. \"He\\'s a warrior, I\\'m telling you,\" Day said. \"He\\'s got the heart of a lion\". This throw was perfect. 🎯@justnfields finds @KayJayHill for the @OhioStateFB TD. Young was back in action after sitting out two games as a penalty for breaking the rules by accepting a personal loan. And he was a force, picking up nine tackles, including three sacks. He has 16 1/2 for the season, the most ever by a Buckeye. Freshman QB Levis finished up Penn State\\'s first scoring drive in the third quarter — capped by an 18-yard touchdown run by Journey Brown — after Sean Clifford left the game with an injury. Coach James Franklin said Clifford was available to come back in but wasn\\'t 100% so he stayed with Levis, who scored on a 1-yard run in the third quarter. \"I was a little nervous the first couple plays, but then it all went away, and I started having fun and doing my thing,\" Levis said. Coincidentally, Levis signed with Penn State after Fields withdrew his commitment to Franklin and chose Georgia in 2018. Fields transferred to Ohio State in January. Things are getting interesting in Columbus. You didn\\'t count out @PennStateFball, did you? Penn State: Statistically, the Nittany Lions were beaten soundly but managed to hang around until late. Journey Brown ran the ball 11 times for 64 yards. \"No one flinched,\" Penn State safety Garrett Taylor said. \"We came out and fought hard\". Ohio State: The Buckeyes outgained the Nittany Lions 417-227 but were stricken by uncharacteristic turnovers. Now it\\'s on to Ann Arbor for the rivalry game against No. \"It\\'s good to have a full game under your belt, especially going into next week,\" linebacker Pete Werner said. The🐐on what this win means to him:. \"Before the game I was tearing up just looking at my big bros who raised me through this process, and you get emotional sometimes.

Follow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy.PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Rashaad Penny stayed patient on the sideline, waited for an opportunity and made the most of it. Penny ran for a career-best 129 yards, including a 58-yard touchdown, Russell Wilson threw one TD pass and the Seattle Seahawks beat the Philadelphia Eagles 17-9 Sunday. A 2018 first-round pick, Penny has 158 fewer carries than Chris Carson, who is closing in on 900 yards this season. \"It\\'s been a big test,\" Penny said about his backup role. \"Just staying poised, waiting my turn and trying to prove I can play but I know I got a great running back in front of me in Chris\". The Seahawks (9-2) remain undefeated on the road in six games. Missing their top three wide receivers, leading rusher and two Pro Bowl offensive linemen, the Eagles (5-6) couldn\\'t do much on offense and hurt themselves with three turnovers inside Seattle territory and another near midfield. The Eagles didn\\'t have wideouts DeSean Jackson, Alshon Jeffery, Nelson Agholor, running back Jordan Howard and right tackle Lane Johnson from the start. Right guard Brandon Brooks left the game in the first quarter. Rookie first-round pick Andre Dillard made his first career start at right tackle after playing the left side all season and was benched at halftime. \"I thought we had a good week of preparation, guys were focused,\" Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \"That was no indication of the performance today\". The Seahawks were without star defensive end Jadeveon Clowney. Philadelphia\\'s defense did its best to keep it close, sacking Wilson six times. But Carson Wentz struggled again and the offense was awful. Wentz was 33 of 45 for 256 yards, one TD, two interceptions and lost two fumbles, including one on a handoff exchange. \"I gotta be better,\" Wentz said. \"No excuses. It starts with me\". Wilson was 13 of 25 for 200 yards, one TD and one pick. \"I thought we played a great game in a sense that we were able to move the ball extremely well against a really tough defense, one of the top defenses we played this year with all their players, all their schemes and all the different things they do,\" Wilson said. Malik Turner made an excellent over-the-shoulder catch on a perfect toss by Wilson for a 33-yard TD and a 7-3 lead. Carson took the handoff on a sweep to the right, stopped and tossed it back to Wilson, who had Turner open down the middle. Penny broke loose up the middle in the fourth for his longest career run to give the Seahawks a 17-3 lead. The Eagles had a first down at the Seahawks 33 early in the second quarter but Wentz\\'s pass to Dallas Goedert was intercepted by Bradley McDougald. They faced a third-and-3 at the Seattle 38 in the third quarter but Wentz\\'s handoff to Miles Sanders resulted in a fumble recovered by Quinton Jefferson and returned to the Eagles 32. Rodney McLeod picked Wilson\\'s pass on the ensuing series. Goedert lost a fumble at the Seahawks 32 in the fourth. Down 17-3, the Eagles got a break when Wilson fumbled on a handoff exchange and Nate Gerry recovered at the Seahawks 31. But J.J. Arcega-Whiteside couldn\\'t haul in Wentz\\'s pass on fourth-and-2 from the 23. Wentz tossed a 2-yard TD pass to Zach Ertz in the final minute. Wilson is the first QB in NFL history to start his career with eight straight winning seasons. Wilson has started all 136 games since his rookie season, including 13 in the playoffs. Four-time All-Pro middle linebacker Bobby Wagner also began his career in 2012 and has started 126 games in that span. \"It\\'s important to acknowledge the marvelous consistency that Russell has brought us and Bobby, too,\" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. \"It\\'s incredibly special to accomplish that\". The Seahawks are 6-0 on the road for the first time in franchise history. The six road wins match the club\\'s single-season best set in 2013. Seahawks: Clowney (hip) traveled to Philadelphia but was ruled out 90 minutes before kickoff. DT Jarran Reed (ankle) left in the first half. FB Nick Bellore (quadricep) left in the third quarter. Eagles: Brooks (illness) exited early. Johnson (concussion), Howard (shoulder), Jeffery (ankle), Agholor (knee) and Jackson (abdomen) were inactive. Seahawks: Host the Minnesota Vikings (8-3) on Monday night Dec. 2. Eagles: Visit the Miami Dolphins (2-9) next Sunday. More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones certainly didn\\'t say he was ready to make any changes to his coaching staff. Didn\\'t exactly give head coach Jason Garrett — or the people who work for him — a vote of confidence when given the chance, either. Garrett, remember, is in the final season of his contract and has seemed to be fighting for his job for years. This much is clear: Jones is not happy with the way things are going for the Cowboys, who are just 6-5 after a 13-9 loss at the New England Patriots on Sunday but still in position to make the playoffs because they sit atop a pitiful NFC East at the moment. \"We\\'ve got a long way to go,\" Jones observed, before adding, as if to emphasize that his roster is not what\\'s causing problems, \"With the makeup of this team, I shouldn\\'t be this frustrated\". Jones called out the team\\'s effort. He noted that there\\'s nothing unusual about being outcoached by Bill Belichick. He pointed to special teams — a blocked punt was the most glaring issue — and averred, in a direct shot at special teams coordinator Keith O\\'Quinn, aspect phase of football \"is 100 percent coaching\". Nothing subtle there. Nor with this statement: \"This is very frustrating, and it\\'s frustrating to me to just be reminded that some of the fundamentals of football and coaching were what beat us out there today\". There were all sorts of factors contributing to this defeat, from penalties to turnovers to a driving rain that made both QBs uncomfortable — yes, even Tom Brady, whose team is 10-1 and keeps winning despite, not because of, its offense — and led some to wonder what took Dak Prescott so long to don a glove on his throwing hand. There were plenty of other questions raised, too. Did the Cowboys prepare properly. Did Garrett make the right choice in taking a late field goal while down by seven points instead of going for it on fourth down. And of most significance: How much patience will Jones show, especially if Dallas stumbles again on Thanksgiving Day against the visiting Buffalo Bills. In case you missed it, here are other top topics after the NFL season\\'s 12th Sunday:. BUT FIRST, LET ME TAKE A SELFIE. Dwayne Haskins was supposed to be on the field to take the last snap of his first win as an NFL quarterback — and the Washington Redskins\\' first home win in more than a year — but he apparently had better things to do. The first-round draft pick couldn\\'t be bothered to participate in the \"victory formation\" (granted, something Washington doesn\\'t get much chance to implement during a 2-9 season), because he was posing for a series of selfies with spectators. \"We were looking for him, too,\" interim coach Bill Callahan said with a chuckle after beating the Detroit Lions 19-16. With a chuckle. \"I think he thought the game was over\". Then, perhaps prompted by a reporter\\'s follow-up question to take the matter more seriously, Callahan was more stern-faced, saying, \"We\\'ll address that\". Haskins, for his part, laughed off the matter, vowing, \"I\\'ll get it next time\". Who knows when that might be. NOT \\'NEW YORK\\'S BEST GAME\\'. New Orleans coach Sean Payton didn\\'t hold back with his criticism of a pass interference ruling from the NFL office during the Saints\\' 34-31 victory over the Carolina Panthers, saying, \"It wasn\\'t New York\\'s best game\". That PI in the closing minutes was called after a challenge from Carolina — ironically enough, given that the officiating error that kept the Saints out of last season\\'s Super Bowl is the reason such reviews are allowed now. \"I don\\'t know that it\\'s exactly what we discussed, where we are today with it,\" Payton said. \"In fact, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not\". WHO NEEDS THE 12TH MAN. The Seahawks make so much of their supposed \"12th man\" and home-field advantage. Turns out they\\'re pretty good away from Seattle, too. Russell Wilson and Co. improved to 6-0 on the road this season, 9-2 overall, with a 17-9 win over the struggling Philadelphia Eagles (5-6) and turnover-prone Carson Wentz. The Seahawks never have won more road games in a full season. AP Sports Writers Jimmy Golen in Foxborough, Mass., and Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed.

More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.NEW YORK (AP) — Herb Magee is the \"Shot Doctor,\" who has worked with kids to the pros on the art of the jumper, while quietly crafting a Hall of Fame coaching career at a Division II program nestled outside Philly\\'s college hoops epicenter. Mike Krzyzewski is simply \"Coach K,\" an NCAA national champion, a national team coach and about the gold standard when it comes to building a perennial Final Four contender as he has for 40 seasons at Duke. Magee and Krzyzewski basketball worlds seem a universe apart, from the suits Coach K wears to the sweats that are on brand for Magee. The salaries, facilities, revenue and headlines generated by each program are akin to a World Series champion and its rookie ball affiliate. Separated by just 103 miles this week, there was a commonality that linked the coaches: Magee joined Krzyzewski as the only NCAA men\\'s coaches to win 1,100 basketball games. Krzyzewski has 1,138 wins (1,065 with Duke) in a career that started with Army in 1975, and added two more victories to the total when he led No. 1 Duke to the 2K Empire Classic championship in front of nearly 20,000 fans at Madison Square Garden. Magee (1,100-440) hit the magic number this week when the Jefferson University Rams beat Kutztown 98-79 in front of maybe 1,000 fans at home on Henry Avenue. \"It means a lot because it\\'s just me and coach Krzyzewski. That\\'s it,\" Magee said. \"I\\'ve been used to that, ever since we went over 1,000 wins. It\\'s always been just Mike Krzyzewski and Herb Magee\". Krzyzewski\\'s career arc is pretty well known among college basketball junkies. Magee, meanwhile, is a bit more anonymous coaching in a city where he jokes the media only comes around when he\\'s nearing another victory milestone. The 78-year-old Magee has spent decades putting the Division II school on the basketball landscape as he passed one Hall of Fame coach after another on his way up the record book. Magee has spent his entire career at the same school, even though it might be hard to tell on his bio sheet: Jefferson U churns through names at the rate some stadiums swap naming rights deals. The private school has been Philadelphia University and Philadelphia Textile, and now Jefferson since 2017. The one constant, Magee racking up 20-win seasons and leading the Rams to the NCAA Tournament. \"I was watching Fox News the other day and the fellow said that he didn\\'t even know Philadelphia University was now Jefferson University,\" Magee said. \"So to get that word out there, and it\\'s been like three or four years, I hope that\\'s part of my job. It\\'s an awful lot of name changes since I\\'ve started\". Magee ended his playing career at Philadelphia Textile as the school\\'s career leading scorer with 2,235 points. He averaged 29.1 points one season and was a two-time small-college All-America selection. The Boston Celtics drafted Magee with the 62nd pick of the 1963 draft. Magee passed on signing with Boston because he broke two fingers on his left hand that summer, a big blow for a shooter, and he felt he couldn\\'t crack a Celtics roster that was stocked with future Hall of Famers. He served as an assistant until 1967 when he took over as head coach and won 21 games. Magee reached the pinnacle in 1970 when the Rams won his only national championship. The Rams won 28 straight games that season and beat Tennessee State in the title game. Magee never did more than flirt with the idea of leaving for a big college program or an NBA assistant job — he said he\\'s passed up offers to coach on all levels — but he made his mark as the Shot Doctor. He used to watch the Philadelphia Warriors at Convention Hall and would emulate the top shooters of the time, like Bob Cousy or Paul Arizin. But Magee has no idea who first dubbed him a shot doc. \"I\\'ve been teaching shooting since I started coaching,\" Magee said. \"I\\'m a good shooter, I can talk to the kids about shooting. I\\'ve never lectured at a camp or a clinic or any place where it hasn\\'t been about shooting\". The 72-year-old Krzyzewski once invited Magee on his radio show and they talked, well, shooting. \"I know of him,\" Krzyzewski said at the Garden. \"But I\\'m not a big stat guy. My wife will tell you, I\\'m going to go watch tape and figure out what the next thing is. All those other things take care of themselves\". Magee and his wife talk each offseason about retirement, and each year Magee is back for the start of another season. Retirement is on hold, and the only worry is Saturday\\'s game. \"Right now, I don\\'t even think about that,\" Magee said. \"I just worry about the next game. But I can tell you right now, the way my wife and I have been talking, we\\'re going to be coaching next year\". Did someone say 1,200 wins. More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski set the record for wins coaching a No. 1 team when his top-ranked Blue Devils knocked off California and Georgetown on back-to-back nights to win the 2K Empire Classic. He will have a chance to add to his 218-34 mark this week. That\\'s because the Blue Devils (6-0) only solidified their tight grip on the No. 1 spot in The Associated Press men\\'s basketball poll Monday. They received 53 first-place votes from the 65-member media panel that regularly covers college basketball, easily out-distancing second-place Louisville. \"There\\'s really no words. You can\\'t put that feeling into words,\" said Duke sophomore Tre Jones, when asked about his Hall of Fame coach. \"No one knows that feeling unless you do play for him\". Of course, Krzyzewski would rather dwell on the progress of his team — which faces Stephen F. Austin on Tuesday night and Winthrop on Friday — than another record on his resume. \"We felt starting practice that we could be good defensively with Tre there and depth. We\\'ve really devoted most of our practice time to defense,\" Krzyzewski said. \"As a result, I think we\\'ve gotten tougher. We\\'ve also spent a lot of time in rebounding. We\\'re finding ourselves offensively. \"We\\'re going to continue to try to find out about ourselves\". The Cardinals avoided Akron\\'s upset bid Sunday to remain No. 2 in the poll, receiving seven first-place votes. Michigan State was third with four No. 1 votes and Kansas was fourth, setting up a showdown between the two heavyweights if they advance to the finals of the Maui Invitational. \"I think this is my fourth time with Kansas. We\\'ve kind of been around and kind of got a feel with what works from that standpoint,\" Jayhawks coach Bill Self said of the Hawaii tournament, \"but that doesn\\'t have anything to do with works during the game\". Maryland jumped North Carolina to round out the top five, while Virginia received the only other first-place vote and was seventh. Gonzaga, Kentucky and Ohio State filled out the top 10. The reigning national champion Cavaliers needed a late comeback to beat Arizona State in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament on Sunday night. They wound up leaning on freshman Casey Morsell and their stingy defense to counter a 19-0 run by the Sun Devils and escape with a 48-45 victory. \"It\\'s always a battle of wills and styles,\" Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. \"We\\'ll keep trying to become more efficient offensively, but we can never give ground defensively. That\\'s our statement\". Baylor was the biggest mover after knocking off then-No. 17 Villanova behind 22 points from Jared Butler at the Myrtle Beach Invitational. The Bears moved up five spots to No. 19 this week. Tennessee climbed three spots to No. 17 after routing Alabama State. Villanova\\'s loss dropped coach Jay Wright\\'s team five spots in the poll, while Xavier fell seven spots to No. 25 after losing to Florida in the Charleston Classic title game Sunday night. The Gators were the only newcomers to the poll this week, and they joined Villanova as the only teams in the poll with two losses. They lost to Florida State and UConn but have won their last three. Texas dropped out of the poll after losing to Georgetown in the 2K Empire Classic semifinals, though the Longhorns rebounded to breeze past Cal in the consolation game. The Seminoles were the first team out of the Top 25, a mere two points behind Xavier. Then came a wide gulf before St. Mary\\'s, Oklahoma and Butler — the latter of whom could meet in the Hall of Fame Classic if they reach the championship game Tuesday night. Kansas and Michigan State are heavy favorites to reach the Maui Invitational title game, while Wisconsin and Auburn highlight the Legends Classic in New York. The most intriguing tournament could be the Battle 4 Atlantis in the Bahamas, where the Tar Heels are joined by Gonzaga, No. 11 Oregon and No. 13 Seton Hall. Unranked Michigan, which also received votes for the AP Top 25, is also in the field at Imperial Arena beginning Wednesday.

The Dolphins didn\\'t get in their way either. Jarvis Landry caught two touchdown passes against his former team and Cleveland won its third straight Sunday, 41-24 over the Miami Dolphins in the Browns\\' first game since losing star defensive end Myles Garrett to a season-ending suspension. Landry couldn\\'t wait to get back at the Dolphins (2-9), who had him for four seasons before they decided not to give him a long-term contract extension and traded him to Cleveland in 2018. He got his revenge, finishing with 10 catches for 148 yards. \"It didn\\'t mean extra, but it was fun,\" Landry said, flashing a smile while speaking at his locker alongside teammate Odell Beckham Jr. \"It feels great to get a win and to finish the game on a positive with everything that\\'s been going on\". Baker Mayfield had 327 yards passing and hit a TD pass to Beckham, and Joe Schobert had two interceptions as the Browns (5-6) continued their climb back into the AFC playoff hunt. The lopsided win capped an emotionally complicated week for the Browns in the aftermath of Garrett being banned by the NFL for pulling off Pittsburgh quarterback Mason Rudolph\\'s helmet and hitting him over the head with it. That touched off a wild brawl in the final seconds of Cleveland\\'s 21-7 win over the Steelers on Nov. 14. Garrett\\'s appeal was denied this week in New York, where he told the league Rudolph used a racial slur, something the league said it didn\\'t find any evidence of. Browns owner Dee Haslam showed her support for Garrett by wearing a stocking cap on the sideline during pregame warmups bearing his No. The Browns managed to stay focused despite the endless talk revolving around Garrett and their upcoming rematch next week with the Steelers. \"It was only a controversy in the media, not in our locker room,\" said defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, who had two sacks. \"Next man up. I was proud of the D-line and proud of the whole team for coming out there and doing what we\\'re supposed to do\". With Garrett gone, there was more pressure on Cleveland\\'s offense to produce, and the unit came through. The Browns scored on four of five possessions inside the red zone. Mayfield completed 24 of 34 passes, but threw his first interception in four weeks. Beckham had six catches for 84 yards, and AFC rushing leader Nick Chubb had 106 yards and scored on a 5-yard run. \"When we got our chances we capitalized,\" said Mayfield. \"We still didn\\'t play good enough, but we still scored 40 points\". Mayfield feasted on a Miami secondary missing three starters. He threw TD passes to Landry and Beckham in the first quarter, and hooked up with Landry again in the second as the Browns opened a 21-0 lead. Later, Kareem Hunt scored on a 6-yard run for his first touchdown with Cleveland to make it 28-0. The Dolphins helped dig their hole. They were called for three pass interference penalties in the first half, failed to convert on a faked punt, and finished the first quarter with 7 total yards. Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick finished 21 of 39 with two TD passes and two interceptions on his 37th birthday. He threw an 11-yard TD pass to tight end Mike Gesicki, scored on an 8-yard run, and threw a 19-yarder to Allen Hurns. \"I\\'ve got to continue to do a better job,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"Overall we need more consistency and that starts with me\". Earlier this week , Landry said he\\'d be \"lying\" if he said he hadn\\'t circled the matchup with Miami on his calendar. He quickly got back at the Dolphins by hauling in a 7-yard TD pass. \"The biggest thing for us was trying to refocus and not let what we were going through distract us,\" he said. \"Everyone had a great mindset coming in. Once they stepped in between the white lines, it\\'s about that game and going 1-0\".

ODDS, ENDS. Schobert became the sixth linebacker in league history to record two interceptions in consecutive games. Cleveland K Austin Seibert made two field goals, but missed a 46-yarder. Landry and Beckham scored TDs in the same game as Browns teammates for the first time. They hadn\\'t done that since Sept. 14, 2013, when they played together at LSU. Landry is the first Browns wide receiver with a touchdown catch in four consecutive games since Kevin Johnson in 2001. Dolphins: Wide receiver Albert Wilson left with rib injury in the third quarter. WR Jakeem Grant went out with an ankle injury following a 25-yard kickoff return. He did not return. Grant ran back a kick 101 yards last week against Buffalo.

A person familiar with the negotiations said Saturday the NBA is working with the players\\' union and its teams on a plan to shorten the regular season, possibly to 78 games. They also are considering a change to the playoff seeding and the addition of a midyear tournament for all 30 clubs in time for the 2021-22 season. The tournament would likely be a way for teams to mitigate the loss of revenue from the shorter regular season and fewer home dates. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no update on the plan has been publicly given by the league. ESPN first reported the progression of the plan on Saturday. The proposal could be sent to the league\\'s board of governors in April for discussion and possibly ratification. NBA broadcast partners ESPN and Turner Sports also are involved in the talks. ESPN also reported the proposal includes a plan to reseed the playoffs after early rounds, potentially creating an NBA Finals between teams from the same conference. The notion of adding a midseason tournament has been something Silver has batted around since at least 2016, drawing the parallel to how such events are customary in European soccer. \"It would need to be negotiated with the Players Association,\" Silver said this year. \"I\\'ve had very general discussions with (union executive director) Michele Roberts about the notion that these are the kinds of things we\\'re looking at. I think she, of course, is supportive of looking at any ideas we have to build the business over time\". The same applies to having a play-in playoff round, which Silver has said he supports. That idea has even reached the proposal stage, reviewed by the league\\'s competition committee and others. The possibility of changing the playoff seeding has been talked about for some time as well. But the drawback to any shortening of the schedule — and perhaps fewer home games — is a decrease in revenue, which everyone would want to avoid. That\\'s where the tournament comes into play, especially since it would involve all teams. More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports.NAPLES, Fla.

The Carolina Panthers could only lament the first-and-goal they squandered just moments earlier in a third straight loss that has placed their playoff prospects in jeopardy. Lutz kicked a 33-yard field goal as time expired, and New Orleans beat Carolina 34-31 on Sunday to take a four-game lead in the NFC South with five games left. \"It\\'s exciting. It\\'s butterflies. But also, it\\'s confidence,\" said Brees, who led the Saints from their own 14-yard line with 1:51 left to the Carolina 15 with 3 seconds remaining. \"It\\'s unity. You feel like everybody knows the challenge ahead. Everybody knows what we need to do in order to accomplish whatever it is we need to accomplish to go win the game. Everybody just kind of locks in and goes\". Lutz\\'s second game-winning kick this season capped a contest filled with late momentum shifts and critical errors — none bigger than Carolina kicker Joey Slye\\'s missed field goal from 28 yards with 2 minutes left. Carolina trailed from early in the first quarter until 9:23 remained in the fourth quarter, when D.J. Moore reached up with his right hand to corral a fourth-and-goal pass in the back of the end zone to tie it at 31.

Soon after, Panthers safety Eric Reid stuffed Alvin Kamara on fourth-and-1 from the New Orleans 45. That set up a dramatic sequence in which Carolina coach Ron Rivera successfully challenged officials\\' decision not to call pass interference on a third-down incomplete pass, giving Carolina a first down on the 3 with 2:21 left. Christian McCaffrey\\'s run was stuffed, Kyle Allen threw incomplete on second down and Allen was sacked on third down by Marcus Davenport, setting the stage for the end of a difficult day for Slye, who\\'d also missed two extra-point kicks. \"I feel terrible,\" Slye said. \"We needed this win\". Brees finished 30 of 39 for 311 yards and three touchdowns, but also was intercepted by Tre Boston, a play that helped Carolina come back in the fourth quarter. Michael Thomas had 10 catches for 101 yards and a touchdown for New Orleans (9-2), including receptions of 14 and 24 yards on the game-winning drive.

Allen passed for 256 yards and three TDs for Carolina (5-6), which saw its playoff hopes pushed to the brink. \"It is incredibly frustrating,\" Allen said. \"Some weeks it\\'s been offense, some weeks it\\'s been defense. We\\'ve just got to put it together and play a complete game\". McCaffrey had 133 yards and two touchdowns from scrimmage on a balance of runs and receptions. Moore had six catches for 126 yards and two TDs, the first a 51-yarder. Christian McCaffrey makes a defender miss on his way into the end zone.

Saints tight end Jared Cook had six catches for 99 yards, including a 20-yard touchdown, and running back Latavius Murray scored the game\\'s first TD on a 26-yard run. PENALTIES AND REVIEWS. New Orleans\\' second touchdown, a 13-yard pass to Tre\\'Quan Smith, was set up by a muffed punt that was initially ruled to have been first touched by New Orleans. Saints coach Sean Payton challenged, and replay showed the ball hit Carolina\\'s Rashaan Gaulden first, giving New Orleans the ball on the Panthers 27, where J.T. Gray had recovered it. That was Payton\\'s second challenge of the first 10 minutes after he\\'d lost a challenge of an offensive pass interference call against Cook. Payton was among those lobbying for a 2019 rule change to allow review of pass interference after a missed call cost the Saints in last season\\'s NFC title game. \"I don\\'t know that it\\'s exactly what we discussed where we are today with it. In fact, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not,\" Payton said. \"But we\\'ve got to be able to adjust\". Carolina\\'s second TD capped a 17-play drive that appeared to have stalled on Davis\\' third-down sack, but defensive end Cameron Jordan was called for unnecessary roughness. Jordan said he had not heard a whistle and was trying to punch the ball loose from Allen. Saints DE Jordan explains his personal foul. Carolina\\'s game-tying TD in the fourth quarter came shortly after a pass interference call against safety Marcus Williams on a long pass in the back of the end zone. Carolina got no extra points after its first three TDs. In addition to Slye\\'s two misses, the Panthers attempted to pass for a 2-point conversion after their second TD, but it was broken up. Panthers: Defensive tackle Dontari Poe appeared to hurt his left leg in the first half. Guard Greg Van Roten also had an apparent left leg injury in the first half. Reid rolled his left ankle in the third quarter but returned to the game. Saints: Left tackle Terron Armstead left in the first half with an apparent leg injury. The Saints already were without left guard Andrus Peat, who normally slides over to tackle when Armstead is out, so Patrick Omameh subbed in at tackle next to guard Nick Easton, who was filling in at left guard.

(AP) — Protesters wearing the colors of both Harvard and Yale staged a sit-in at midfield of Yale Bowl during halftime of the 136th edition of the annual football rivalry known as The Game. Most walked off after about an hour with a police escort; about 20-30 who remained were arrested. A few dozen protesters initially trickled onto the field as the Yale band finished performing its halftime routine, some holding a banner asking the schools\\' presidents to divest from the fossil fuel industry. Other signs referred to Puerto Rican debt and the treatment of the Uighurs. Yale officials said in a statement handed to reporters in the press box during the fourth quarter that the school \"stands firmly for the right to free expression\". \"It is regrettable,\" a statement attributed to the Ivy League said, \"that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities\". Between 20 and 30 people were arrested, released and given a court date, protest organizers said. Rachel Sadoff, a junior at Harvard, said about 150 students from the two universities planned to participate and about 100 more who had been sitting in the stands joined in. \"Our goal was to spread the word,\" Sadoff said. \"If more people speak up, our colleges will have to listen\". Largely of college age but with a few older protesters mixed in, the group chanted: \"Hey Hey! Fossil fuels have got to go!\" One banner read \"This is an emergency\". Mostly they sat or milled around near midfield, with some taking selfies; a vape pen and a crushed can of beer were left behind. Police in yellow vests lined up alongside the sit-in but did not intervene. When the 15-minute halftime expired and the protest continued, hundreds more fans streamed onto the field to join in. Fans remaining in the stands began to boo, but only briefly. The public address announcer implored the group to leave, repeating, \"As a courtesy to both teams, the game must resume\". Protesters responded by chanting, \"OK, boomer\". Players tried to remain warm on the sideline in mid-40 temperatures, but then returned to their locker rooms. Harvard coach Tim Murphy was given an update from the game officials and public safety officers as the protest continued. Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins spoke to the protesters over a megaphone, trying to convince them that they had made their point, but it would be lost if the situation escalated. After about an hour, police formed a line and moved forward, from the Yale sideline toward the Harvard sideline. A protest leader encouraged all \"internationals\" to leave. An agreement was reached to escort the remainders off, with one police officer to every two protesters. Those who did not leave then were informed by Higgins that they would be arrested. Asked how many people were taken into custody, Higgins referred questions to the police public information officer. Messages left with Yale and New Haven police were not immediately returned. Yale coach Tony Reno said the team reverted to its plans for when a game is interrupted by lightning. The Bulldogs rallied from a 17-point, fourth-quarter deficit, winning 50-43 in double overtime in darkness in the unlit, century-old Yale Bowl to clinch the Ivy League championship and conclude one of the strangest editions in the rivalry\\'s 144-year history. \"It\\'s what makes Yale Yale,\" Reno said. \"Our group, I\\'m sure if you asked them and the Harvard guys what makes it special, it\\'s not only the game of football. It\\'s the passions\". More AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25.The NBA is investigating an incident between Boston guard Marcus Smart and a fan in Denver, after the Celtics guard said he heard a derogatory comment and was unhappy with the way that he believed security in the arena responded to the matter. Smart said a fan told him to \"get on your knees\" after he pursued a loose ball along the sideline during Friday\\'s game in Denver. Smart said one of his feet got tangled in frame of a courtside chair, and while he was trying to free himself he heard the comment. NBA spokesman Tim Frank said Saturday the league is investigating the matter. \"The fan told me, \\'That\\'s right, stay on the ground, get on your knees,\\'\" Smart told reporters postgame Friday night. \"Excuse me? I just told him, \\'Listen, just watch the game because if we retaliate to you guys and if we were on the street, I guarantee you wouldn\\'t say that\". Smart said security at Denver\\'s Pepsi Center essentially ignored him. At least one security guard was seen speaking to fans in that section moments after the fourth-quarter incident, but it was unclear if any further action was taken. \"I told them who it was,\" Smart said. \"They just looked at him and didn\\'t even say anything to him, didn\\'t even get him out of the game. Probably if I was a superstar, they probably would have did something but it is what it is. We\\'re going to end up protecting ourselves eventually and it\\'s not going to be pretty for those fans and we don\\'t want that. The league doesn\\'t want that\". The incident is just the latest in several derogatory exchanges that have caught the NBA\\'s attention in recent months. Russell Westbrook, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry and others were involved in such incidents last seasons, prompting the NBA to say that it wants arena security personnel to have zero tolerance for abusive or hateful behavior. Last season, Westbrook and Cousins were subjected to racist taunts in Salt Lake City and Boston and the fans involved in those incidents were banned by the Jazz and Celtics. Lowry was shoved by a minority partner of the Golden State Warriors\\' ownership group, seated courtside during the NBA Finals, and that person was banned from team business for a year by the league. The league has not released exact numbers of how many fans have been ejected for such incidents. But after a number of players met with the NBA this past offseason to air their concerns about safety and fan behavior, the league expanded the area in arenas most closely monitored when it comes to player-fan interaction. The top-priority area used to be just those seated with feet on the court itself or maybe the first couple rows of courtside seats; now, that area goes several rows deep in every building, plus the areas where teams and referees enter and exit the court. \"That\\'s a problem in the league that we\\'ve got to fix,\" Smart said. \"If we retaliate to protect ourselves, we\\'re the ones getting in trouble. They\\'re not. And that\\'s not right. There\\'s nowhere in this league for it\". This is not the first incident between Smart and a fan. In 2014, when he was playing for Oklahoma State, Smart was suspended three games for shoving a Texas Tech fan after a play where he crashed into some baseline seats following a blocked shot. Smart got up, then turned around and exchanged words with the fan before giving him a two-handed shove. Smart later apologized, and said it was \"a lesson I\\'ll have to learn from\".

(AP) — After a handful of college basketball games, several teams have ascended to the mountaintop only to be knocked off the throne. So far, a different team has sat atop The Associated Press men\\'s college basketball poll in each of the first three weeks for only the second time in history. There doesn\\'t seem to be an Alpha that will set the tone this year. Bluebloods like current No. 1 Duke, No. 5 North Carolina and No. 9 Kentucky have still-developing young talent, yet there doesn\\'t appear to be a team like the Blue Devils last season or the 2015 Kentucky team that carried an unbeaten record to the Final Four. Those teams were stacked with enough top-tier NBA talent to frequently play like overwhelming title favorites. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s a dominant team this year,\" Kansas coach Bill Self said. \"You saw that in New York (at the Champions Classic). But there\\'s a lot of good teams and that\\'s going to make it interesting all season\". There certainly has been a few shockers so far. Evansville upended then-No. 1 Kentucky at Rupp Arena. Florida (No. 6 in preseason) and St. Mary\\'s (No. 20) have fallen out of the Top 25 after losses to unranked teams. And that could signal an open door for an unexpected team — like a George Mason in 2006 or Loyola-Chicago two years ago — to make a surprise appearance in Atlanta come April. \"There is absolutely no team that you can look at right now and say: \\'I don\\'t care what the matchup is, this team\\'s playing deep into the tournament and then they\\'ll get to the Final Four,\\'\" said ACC Network analyst Jordan Cornette, who played at Notre Dame from 2001-05. The turnover atop the AP poll stands out, in particular. It started with Michigan State claiming the preseason No. 1 ranking for the first time, only to lose on opening night to then-No. 2 Kentucky in the Champions Classic in New York. That pushed the Wildcats to No. 1 for what appeared to be a long stay with seven straight games at Rupp and no power-conference opponent until Dec. 14 — only to lose as a 25-point favorite to a Purple Aces team picked to finish eighth in the Missouri Valley Conference. Now it\\'s Duke\\'s turn, marking the first time each of the first three AP polls had a different No. 1 since Syracuse, North Carolina and Kentucky did it to start the 1987-88 season, according to Sportradar. Yet this version of the top-ranked Blue Devils illustrates how different things are this year. Duke monopolized last year\\'s spotlight amid the incomparable athleticism of national player of the year Zion Williamson, while fellow talented freshmen RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish gave the Blue Devils three top-10 NBA draft picks for a team that reached the NCAA Elite Eight. This year\\'s group lacks the no-doubt star capable of scoring in any situation, though it has a much deeper rotation with its latest touted recruiting class enabling Mike Krzyzewski\\'s Blue Devils to play with a fullcourt defensive edge that has overwhelmed early opponents. \"Last year was a team in its own,\" junior Alex O\\'Connell said. \"I think this year we\\'re definitely a more balanced team and we have more guys that are capable of coming in off the bench or being a starter and having a hot night\". That doesn\\'t sound — or look like — a team that will strike overwhelming fear in opponents. Duke wasn\\'t the only team to lose high NBA picks, Kentucky and UNC each lost three first-rounders, two in the lottery. And reigning national champion Virginia lost No. 4 overall pick De\\'Andre Hunter, first-rounder Ty Jerome and Final Four most outstanding player Kyle Guy. While those teams have added talented players like Cole Anthony at the point for the Tar Heels, it takes time for new rosters to develop chemistry, making them vulnerable against teams with far more experience playing together. Teams like America East Conference favorite Vermont, a veteran team led by a reigning conference player of the year in senior Anthony Lamb. Days after hitting the shot to beat St. John\\'s, Lamb had 30 points with seven 3-pointers against Virginia\\'s traditionally tough defense, and Vermont gave the seventh-ranked Cavaliers fits on their homecourt before falling 61-55. Other ranked teams haven\\'t been as fortunate. Florida opened as a top-10 team but Mike White\\'s Gators fell out after losing at home to unranked Florida State and then at unranked Connecticut. As for St. Mary\\'s, the Gaels fell out of the poll after losing at home to a Winthrop team picked to finish third in the Big South Conference. It\\'s an example of why Cornette compared the process of top teams finding themselves to \"a string of bad first dates\" with everyone \"watching that awkwardness play itself out right in front of you in real time\". \"If you\\'ve got a group that has played together for three seasons, two seasons, I\\'m intrigued by that team\\'s chance because they\\'re in rhythm, they\\'re in sync,\" Cornette said. \"No matter how talented these other guys are, it\\'s a bunch of talent trying to figure out how to share one ball\".

Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap.MOSCOW (AP) — The president of the Russian track and field federation resigned on Saturday, two days after he was accused of obstructing an anti-doping investigation involving fake medical documents. Eight months before the Olympics in Tokyo, Russia is facing a double threat on doping-linked charges, including another case centered on alleged tampering with lab data provided to the World Anti-Doping Agency. Track federation president Dmitry Shlyakhtin stepped down at an emergency federation conference in Moscow. He was already provisionally suspended pending a hearing on the charges from the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). Runner-turned-businesswoman Yulia Tarasenko has been appointed acting president. However, she immediately faced a backlash from Russia\\'s most decorated active athlete, the three-time world high jump champion Mariya Lasitskene. \"Tarasenko is Shlyakhtin\\'s stooge and should get out of the federation immediately, following her super-professional boss,\" Lasitskene told state news agency Tass. Lasitskene sarcastically congratulated the board members who voted in Tarasenko. \"Well done, the operation to liquidate Russian athletics is nearly complete,\" she said. WADA said Friday a key panel had recommended the country be declared non-compliant for allegedly tampering with lab data in a separate case. That could lead to Russia being banned from the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Russia\\'s track team was reduced to a single athlete in 2016 amid earlier doping revelations. Russia\\'s head track coach Yuri Borzakovsky indicated one path could be for Russia to compete at the Olympics as an officially neutral team, as it did at the 2018 Winter Olympics. \"The main task is that the athletes and their coaches don\\'t suffer in the current situation, so that the guys can keep training for the Olympics and compete there,\" he said. \"In what status they compete, that\\'s another question\". A politically well-connected regional sports minister, Shlyakhtin took office in January 2016 pledging to overturn Russia\\'s suspension from international track events due to widespread doping. Nearly four years later, the suspension is still in place. World Athletics, formerly known as the IAAF, said Friday that Russia could be expelled altogether following the new charges against Shlyakhtin and senior officials. Shlyakhtin is one of seven people charged Thursday following an investigation into the medical files presented as an alibi by high jumper Danil Lysenko last year. He was facing a ban for failing to make himself available for drug testing. AIU investigators allege officials helped Lysenko draw up the fake documents so he could avoid punishment. World Athletics could also end a scheme which allows top Russian athletes such as Lasitskene to compete internationally as neutrals. World Athletics\\' \"statements are beyond comprehension,\" Tarasenko said. She didn\\'t elaborate on how, or if, the federation intended to fight the charges. \"We\\'re not feeling very joyful, put it that way,\" said Tarasenko, who was a sprinter in the 1990s and is now CEO of a company laying running tracks at stadiums. \"We think there\\'s still some chance to keep fighting for the federation\".

Lions in 2011, is the first Canadian to be selected Grey Cup MVP since Russ Jackson of the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1969. \"That sounds good, but the only trophy I want is the big silver one,\" Harris said. \"It\\'s surreal, it\\'s amazing, it\\'s a dream come true. I\\'m so proud to be a Winnipegger\". With the temperature in the mid-30s with little wind, Harris opened the scoring in the first quarter with a 15-yard run and caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from backup Chris Streveler in the second quarter. Harris finished with six catches for 35 yards. Harris served a two-game suspension for a positive drug test this season, but still led the CFL in rushing for the third straight season. \"I just wanted to prove it to my teammates and deliver for my teammates,\" Harris said. \"Everything else is whatever. We just wanted to win this game. We\\'ve been underdogs (and) counted out all year and even for myself I\\'ve been counted out and disrespected. It was a Blue Bomber-style game and that\\'s how we wanted to do it\". Zach Collaros, the former University of Cincinnati quarterback who spent time with Saskatchewan and Toronto this season before landing in Winnipeg in October, completed 17 of 23 passes for 170 yards. Streveler was 3 for 3 for 39 yards. Justin Medlock tied the Grey Cup record with six field goals and salvaged a single on his lone miss. Defensive end Willie Jefferson had three of Winnipeg\\'s six sacks and forced two fumbles. \"To be playing such a big game, the biggest game of the year and to play their best football, is very impressive,\" Winnipeg coach Mike O\\'Shea said. \"They certainly rose to the occasion and got after it. They should be extremely proud of that fact\". Dane Evans threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Bralon Addison in the third quarter for Hamilton. The Tiger-Cats, a CFL-best 15-3 in the regular season, won their last championship in 1999. \"It hurts real bad. I\\'m not going to lie,\" Evans said. \"It just sucks, man. Honestly, it is just terrible. Not the way we would have pictured it. Not the way that we wanted it and it\\'s all because of us. We had a great game plan but we just didn\\'t execute\". Hamilton lost Brandon Banks, the speedy receiver honored this week at the league\\'s Most Outstanding Player, to a leg injury in the third quarter. Winnipeg was third in the West at 11-7 in the regular season.CLEVELAND (AP) — Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph didn\\'t escape the brawl with the Browns unpunished. Rudolph was fined $50,000 on Saturday by the NFL for his involvement in the melee that began when Browns defensive end Myles Garrett pulled off his helmet and hit him over the head with it. Rudolph avoided suspension for his actions — he tried to pull off Garrett\\'s helmet and charged him — but was one of 33 players fined by the league for their involvement. The league penalized 29 players $3,507 apiece for \"entering the fight area\". In all, the league handed out more than $700,000 for discipline stemming from the ugly final seconds of Cleveland\\'s 21-7 win over Pittsburgh last week. There was another $77,206 assessed for personal fouls earlier in the game. Garrett was indefinitely suspended by the league for tearing off Rudolph\\'s helmet and using it \"as a weapon\". His appeal was denied this week when he told appeals officer James Thrash that Rudolph used a racial slur against him. Rudolph wrestled with Garrett and unsuccessfully tried to yank off the Pro Bowler\\'s helmet before running after him and then being struck on the top of the head. Earlier this week, Rudolph said there was \"no acceptable excuse,\" for his behavior. He has denied using the racial slur, and the league has found no evidence such a slur was used. The league also fined the Steelers and Browns $250,000 apiece. The AFC North rivals play again Dec. 1 in Pittsburgh. Garrett was also fined $45,623 for his shocking attack, which will cost him the rest of the regular season and playoffs — if Cleveland qualifies without him. Garrett will also lose $1.14 million in game checks. The league said Garrett must meet with Commissioner Roger Goodell\\'s office before he can be reinstated. Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey was suspended three games and fined $35,096 for punching and kicking Garrett. Appeals officer Derrick Brooks reduced Pouncey\\'s ban to two, but he\\'ll miss next Sunday\\'s game against the Steelers. Browns defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi was suspended for Sunday\\'s game against Miami for shoving Rudolph to the ground. Thrash upheld Ogunjobi\\'s suspension but rescinded his $10,527 fine.

(AP) — A strip sack on the opening drive that set up a touchdown got the San Francisco 49ers off to a rousing start to a grueling three-game stretch. A near flawless performance by Jimmy Garoppolo and a dominant performance by the defense finished off Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. Garoppolo threw two long touchdown passes and the San Francisco harassed Rodgers into one of the worst performances of his brilliant career, leading the 49ers to a 37-8 victory over the Packers on Sunday in the first of three straight games against first-place teams. \"Apparently nobody has to play us. We just have to play everybody. We\\'re just the punching bag people come punch on,\" said cornerback Richard Sherman, clearly piqued by the talk of how difficult San Francisco\\'s upcoming opponents are. \"We don\\'t worry about the outside noise. We understand what kind of team we have and we don\\'t worry about the opponent because you can\\'t control what they do\". Garoppolo connected on a 42-yard touchdown strike to Deebo Samuel in the second quarter and a 61-yarder to George Kittle in the third to start this stretch for San Francisco (10-1) off on a high note. Following this game against the first-place Packers (8-3), the Niners will travel to Baltimore (8-2) and New Orleans (9-2) the next two weeks in a stretch that will go a long way to determining whether San Francisco will be able to hold off Seattle (9-2) in a tight NFC West race. \"We crave every single game,\" defensive tackle DeForest Buckner said. \"Every week is a new challenge. The good thing about this team is we don\\'t get scared of who our next opponent is or \\'Oh this team is supposed to be a top team.\\' It\\'s just another team. We know how good we are. We just have to show it every chance we get\". Rodgers lost a fumble on the opening drive one of the five sacks he took and failed to convert a single third down on 13 tries before getting pulled late in the fourth quarter. He finished 20 for 33 for 104 yards and Green Bay averaged an anemic 1.7 yards per pass play when he was in the game. \"There wasn\\'t a whole lot positive tonight,\" Rodgers said. \"A lot of the stuff we talked about during the week, eliminating negative yardage plays, obviously we didn\\'t do that. They got after us up front, and the coverage was good on the back end\". After allowing 78 points the past three weeks in two games against Arizona\\'s Kyler Murray and one against Seattle\\'s Russell Wilson, the Niners\\' defense was back to its dominant form. San Francisco allowed 198 yards on 70 plays, didn\\'t allow a single completion longer than 15 yards and got a key stop against Aaron Jones on a fourth-and-1 run in the first half when the outcome was still in doubt. Garoppolo then put it away with the two long touchdowns, part of a day when he went 14 for 20 for 253 yards and most importantly committed no turnovers. He was helped by the return of Kittle, who had six catches for 129 yards in his first game back after missing the past two contests with injuries to his knee and ankle. \"Our guys aren\\'t just in there pumped about where we\\'re at,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said. \"They\\'re pumped about the possibilities where we can go\". The 49ers broke it open late in the first half after forcing the Packers to punt following the two-minute warning. Garoppolo threw a 42-yard TD pass to Samuel to cap a three-play drive that made it 20-0. The Niners then forced a three-and-out and took over at their 48 with 24 seconds left. Garoppolo completed a 22-yard pass to Kittle that set up Chase McLaughlin\\'s 48-yard field goal. The Packers got into an early hole when Fred Warner sacked Rodgers on the opening drive, forcing a fumble that Nick Bosa recovered at the 2. It was the first opening-drive turnover for Green Bay since the 2017 season finale when Brett Hundley threw an interception against Detroit. The last time it happened with Rodgers at quarterback came in the 2017 opener when he threw an interception against Seattle. Tevin Coleman ran it in on the next play, marking the second time this season San Francisco scored on its first play. Matt Breida scored on an 83-yard run last month against Cleveland. The Niners were the first team since the 2013 Raiders to score twice on the opening play in a single season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Packers: RT Bryan Bulaga left in the first quarter with a knee injury. 49ers: G Mike Person left in the fourth quarter with a stinger. DT Jullian Taylor left late in the game with a jaw injury. Packers: At New York Giants on Sunday. 49ers: At Baltimore on Sunday. More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.LAS VEGAS (AP) — One rematch down, one to go for Deontay Wilder. Wilder landed a vicious right hand to stop Luis Ortiz in the seventh round Saturday night to retain his heavyweight title and set up a lucrative rematch with Tyson Fury in February. Wilder\\'s punch came out of nowhere in a fight he had done little in up until that time. It landed flush on the face of Ortiz, who crumpled to the canvas and was unable to get up at the count of 10. The sudden ending came after a lackluster first six rounds in which Wilder did little. But the devastating power that has gotten him knockouts in all but two of his fights came through again. \"I finally found my measurement and I took the shot,\"\\' Wilder said. \"`I had to play around with him. I had to calculate certain moves.\\'\". The fight was a rematch of a bout last year when Wilder stopped Ortiz on the 10th round. It set up a Feb. 23 fight against Fury that has already been signed. Wilder fought cautiously for the first six rounds, finding himself in the hole on the cards of the three ringside judges. Two gave him just one of the six, while a third gave him two rounds. The Associated Press had Ortiz pitching a shutout. Wilder began to pick up the pace in the seventh round, then caught Ortiz with the right hand that brought the fight to an end at 2:51 of the round. ``My intellect is very high in the ring and no one gives me credit,\\'\\' Wilder said. ``I think I buzzed him with a left hook earlier in the round and I took it from there.\\'\\'. Ortiz (31-2) didn\\'t protest the ending, but said he thought he beat the count. \"I was clear headed when I hit the canvas\\'\\' he said. ``When I heard the referee say seven I was trying to get up but I guess the count went a little quicker than I thought.\\'\\'. Wilder (42-0-1, 41 knockouts) displayed the massive power that has made him a force in the heavyweight division, but won no style points in winning the fight. He did little until the big punch that ended the fight, wary of the power that Ortiz showed when he hurt him in their first fight in March 2018. Wilder made at least $3 million for the fight, but figures to make much more when he and Fury meet in a rematch of their fight a year ago that ended in a disputed draw. His win helped clarify the top of the heavyweight division, though, which will be sorted out further when Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr. meet Dec. 7 in their title rematch in Saudi Arabia. ``Next we have Tyson Fury in the rematch,\\'\\' Wilder said. ``Then I want unification. I want one champion, one face and one heavyweight champion — Deontay Wilder.\\'\\'. Wilder said before the fight that he would end it with a knockout, and he was a 4-1 favorite going in. Oddsmakers had made the over/under for the fight at seven full rounds, and Wilder\\'s right hand made winners of the under with just nine seconds to spare. The 40-year-old Ortiz, who left Cuba to pursue a pro career, seemed to baffle Wilder with his southpaw style. He was also able to get off combinations quickly when Wilder punched first. ``Ortiz is one of the best in the world,\\'\\' Wilder said. ``You have to give him that. \\'\\'.EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Jamal Adams and the New York Jets heard all the rowdy Raiders fans during pregame warmups, booing them and acting as if they were in Oakland. Then the Jets silenced them quickly with a dominant home victory. Sam Darnold threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Jets past the Raiders 34-3 on Sunday for their first three-game winning streak in over two years. \"I\\'m not going to lie to you, when we came on to the field, we felt disrespected,\" Adams said. \"We got booed in our own home stadium by the Oakland fans. We came back into this locker room and it was a hell of a talk\". Adams wouldn\\'t divulge what was said, but the playmaking safety acknowledged he \"sparked it off\". Whatever was said, it worked. Brian Poole returned an interception 15 yards for a TD and the rest of the defense made things miserable for Derek Carr, who was pulled by coach Jon Gruden with just under two minutes left in the third quarter. The Raiders (6-5) came into a rain-soaked MetLife Stadium on a three-game winning streak with an eye on a possible AFC West first-place showdown at Kansas City next week. Instead, they got outplayed by a suddenly resurgent Jets (4-7) team that pulled away in the second half. \"We got our butts kicked,\" Carr said. \"There\\'s no other way around that. They got after us from start to finish. Hopefully, it\\'s an eye opener\". Darnold was 20 of 29 for 315 yards — the fourth 300-yard game of his career — with TDs to Robby Anderson and Ryan Griffin in another efficient outing that helped New York to its first three-game winning streak since Weeks 3-5 of the 2017 season. The Jets didn\\'t punt until the 2-minute mark of the third quarter. Coach Adam Gase took Darnold out in the closing minutes and had backup David Fales finish. And all those boisterous Raiders fans? Most were gone by then. \"I don\\'t want to sound very arrogant or too cocky, but I think they came in a little too happy,\" Adams said of Raiders fans. \"I think they thought it was going to be an easy game\". New York took a 13-3 lead into halftime and came out quickly in the second half. On the Jets\\' third play of the third quarter, Braxton Berrios took a short pass from Darnold on a slant and zipped down the field for 69 yards before being pushed out of bounds at the 1. Darnold found a wide-open Ryan Griffin for a touchdown on the next play. Griffin, signed to a three-year contract extension Saturday night, has a career-high five touchdown catches this season. The Jets\\' No. 1-ranked run defense then came up big on Oakland\\'s first possession of the second half, stuffing Alec Ingold for no gain on fourth-and-1 from the Raiders 39. New York took over and used some razzle-dazzle, Darnold handing off to Bilal Powell, who flipped it to Jamison Crowder — who then tossed it back to the Jets quarterback. Darnold then threw to Anderson, who reached up for a 30-yard gain. Three plays later, Darnold connected with Anderson again for a 1-yard touchdown. On the Raiders\\' next possession, Carr\\'s first-down pass was deflected by Neville Hewitt and landed in Poole\\'s hands. The Jets cornerback ran it in from 15 yards, giving New York a 34-3 lead. Carr lasted one more series before being pulled for Mike Glennon. Carr finished 15 of 27 for 127 yards with the pick-6. Rookie Josh Jacobs, fourth in the NFL in rushing, was held to 34 on 10 carries. The Jets came in allowing a league-low 79.1 yards rushing, and gave up 68 to Oakland. \"You ever been on a boat that\\'s sinking?\" Gruden asked. \"It\\'s not happy. It\\'s not pleasant. It\\'s adversity. It\\'s football. You\\'ve got to respond to adversity. We didn\\'t do a good enough job as coaches rallying our troops today\". Trailing 3-0 after Daniel Carlson\\'s 48-yard field goal, the Jets appeared to score a touchdown on their opening drive for a team-record fifth straight game. But Darnold\\'s 8-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas was wiped away by a questionable penalty when officials called Daniel Brown for offensive pass interference after a video review. New York settled for a tying 24-yard field goal by Sam Ficken. The Jets then benefited from what appeared to be another shaky call on their next drive. Darnold was sacked by Maxx Crosby from the 9, but Maurice Hurst was called for roughing the passer; officials ruled he dived on the pile late. Instead of a huge loss of yardage and down, it put the ball at the Raiders 4. Darnold faked the handoff to Le\\'Veon Bell, then kept the ball, ran up the middle and trucked through D.J. Swearinger for a 4-yard touchdown that gave New York a 10-3 lead early in the second quarter. \"I had someone in my way at the goal line,\" Darnold said, \"and I just did what I could to get into the end zone\". Carr fell to 2-9 in his career in games that started with the temperature below 50 degrees. The temperature at kickoff at the Meadowlands was 43 degrees. Raiders: Rookie WR Hunter Renfrow injured his ribs in the third quarter and didn\\'t return. Jets: Rookie RT Chuma Edoga will have an MRI on Monday after he left early in the second quarter with an injured left knee. He was helped off the field without putting any weight on the leg and didn\\'t return. Raiders: stay on the road to face AFC West-rival Kansas City next Sunday. Jets: take on the Bengals at Cincinnati next Sunday. More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL.Pune, Maharashtra, November 12, 2019 (Wired Release) Prudour Pvt.

Waymo released a training video on YouTube Thursday geared toward guiding public safety officials responding to incidents involving their self-driving cars. The 14-minute instructional video advises how to put a car in manual mode and what precautions firefighters should take. The video was done in conjunction with Waymo engineers and suburban Phoenix police and firefighters. Waymo is among several companies that has been testing autonomous vehicle programs in Arizona. The video comes two days after the National Transportation Safety Board found a distracted human safety driver caused a fatal crash of an autonomous Uber car. The NTSB also condemned a lack of state and federal regulation of testing on public roads.NEW YORK (AP) — New York lawmakers are asking for public input on ways to better protect consumer data and privacy online. The state Senate Standing Committee on Internet and Technology is holding a hearing Friday. Consumer advocates and representatives of internet companies are set to testify. Lawmakers are exploring how to protect consumers who face the sale of personal data by Google, Amazon, Facebook and other internet companies. Democratic Sen. Kevin Thomas tells Newsday he\\'ll sponsor legislation to require companies to better inform consumers about how they collect, use and sell their personal information. The senator says regulations and oversight are needed to update state laws and protect consumers.NEW YORK (AP) — The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):. Stocks are closing higher on Wall Street after three days of losses as a week of worry about trade talks between the U.S. and China winds down. The modest gains Friday weren\\'t enough to erase a weekly loss for the S&P 500 index, its first after six weeks of gains. Banks and companies that rely on consumer spending were among the gainers, outweighing losses in technology and real estate. Nordstrom surged 10.6% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the retailer said it made a bigger profit last quarter than Wall Street expected. The S&P 500 rose 6 points, or 0.2%, to 3,110. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 109 points, or 0.4%, to 27,875. The Nasdaq added 13 points, or 0.2%, to 8,519. Stocks are mixed in midday trading as a week dominated by ups and downs in U.S.-China trade talks comes to a close. President Donald Trump said Friday that a deal between the world\\'s largest economies is \"potentially very close\" after Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing is working to \"try not to have a trade war\". Banks and retailers were doing well, offsetting declines in technology companies. JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, while Intuit sank 4.8%. The S&P 500 rose 2 points, or 0.1%, to 3,106. The index is on track for its first losing week in the past seven. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 75 points, or 0.3%, to 27,842. The Nasdaq was little changed at 8,502. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.76%. Technology companies and banks are leading stocks slightly higher on Wall Street in early trading, putting the market on track for its first gain since Monday. Oracle rose 1.2% in the first few minutes of trading Friday and Wells Fargo added 0.9%. The gains weren\\'t enough to erase a weekly loss for the S&P 500 index, which is on track to break a six-week winning streak. The gains were broad. In a sign investors were feeling more optimistic, safe-play sectors like utilities were pulling up the rear. The S&P 500 rose 4 points, or 0.1%, to 3,108. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44 points, or 0.1%, to 27,808. The Nasdaq added 15 points, or 0.2%, to 8,521. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.76%.LONDON (AP) — London\\'s transit authority on Monday refused to renew Uber\\'s operating license over concerns about impostor drivers, with the ride-hailing company vowing to appeal the decision as it struggles to secure its future in the British capital. It\\'s the latest chapter in Uber\\'s rocky history with London transport officials, who have subjected the San Francisco-based tech company to ever tighter scrutiny over concerns about passenger safety and security. Uber called the decision \"extraordinary and wrong,\" and has 21 days to file an appeal, which it said it would do. It can continue operating during the appeals process. Transport for London cited \"several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk\" in its decision not to extend Uber\\'s license, which expires at midnight Monday. Among other things, unauthorized drivers carried out thousands of rides, the regulator said. \"While we recognize Uber has made improvements, it is unacceptable that Uber has allowed passengers to get into minicabs with drivers who are potentially unlicensed and uninsured,\" said Helen Chapman, director of licensing and regulation at Transport for London, known as TFL. \"We cannot be confident that similar issues won\\'t happen again in future\". The company fired back, pointing out that TFL had found it fit and proper in its most recent license renewal in September. \"We understand we\\'re held to a high bar, as we should be. But this TfL decision is just wrong\" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted. \"Over the last 2 years we have fundamentally changed how we operate in London\". The denial in a lucrative European market is a big setback for Uber as it struggles to turn a profit. The company posted a $1.16 billion loss in the latest quarter and Khosrowshahi forecast it wouldn\\'t make a profit until 2021. Shares fell 1.3% in New York. TFL had already been keeping Uber on a tight leash. It had revoked Uber\\'s license once before, in 2017, but a court later granted it a license lasting 15 months, which TFL then extended for two more months in September, but added 20 conditions. In the latest decision, the transit authority said it was concerned Uber\\'s systems \"seem to have been comparatively easily manipulated\" by drivers. One key issue was a change to Uber\\'s systems allowing unauthorized drivers to upload their photos to other driver accounts. This let them pick up passengers as though they were the booked Uber driver on at least 14,000 trips, which means all those journeys were uninsured, TFL said. The change also resulted in some passengers traveling with unlicensed drivers, including one whose license was previously revoked by TFL. TFL faulted Uber for another \"failure\" that allowed dismissed or suspended drivers to create a new account and carry passengers. And it cited other \"serious breaches\" involving unspecified insurance-related issues. Uber said it has audited every London driver over the past two months and will soon launch a new \"facial matching process\" for its Microsoft-powered verification system, which requires drivers to periodically take selfies for comparison with their account photos. Drivers will have to more actively confirm their identity by blinking, smiling or turning their head — part of recently announced beefed up safety measures. Investors shouldn\\'t be under the impression the phony photo issue is limited to London, said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, who estimated London represents 3% to 5% of Uber\\'s business. \"Regulators around the world are going to scrutinize this issue, peel away the onion and make sure there are no similar issues,\" he said. In the U.S., safety advocates have criticized Uber for conducting less thorough background checks on drivers than traditional taxi companies, which generally check drivers\\' fingerprints against databases. Uber has been slugging it out with regulators in recent months and losing. California recently passed legislation to make companies treat rideshare drivers as employees instead of independent contractors, which could force Uber to provide health and other costly benefits. New Jersey\\'s labor department recently sought more than $640 million from Uber, saying it misclassified drivers as independent contractors, and New York has enacted a minimum wage for drivers, which Uber passed along to customers in the form of higher prices. \"It feels like the regulators have the upper hand,\" Ives said.

A week after the gasoline hike, the loosening of the internet shutdown suggests Iran\\'s government believes it put down the demonstrations that rapidly turned violent, seeing gas stations, banks and stores burned to the ground. America\\'s top diplomat urged demonstrators to send videos \"documenting the regime\\'s crackdown\" as the U.S. sanctioned Iranian minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi. Amnesty International said it believes the unrest and the crackdown killed at least 106 people. Iran disputes that figure without offering its own. A U.N. office earlier said it feared the unrest may have killed \"a significant number of people\". Jahromi, the first government minister to be born after Iran\\'s 1979 Islamic Revolution, is widely believed to be considering a presidential run in 2021. In sanctioning him, the U.S. Treasury noted he once worked for the country\\'s Intelligence Ministry and \"has advanced the Iranian regime\\'s policy of repressive internet censorship\". \"Iran\\'s leaders know that a free and open internet exposes their illegitimacy, so they seek to censor internet access to quell anti-regime protests,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. Jahromi, known for his social media persona, did not immediately respond to the sanctions but has increasingly criticized President Donald Trump on Twitter, a service long blocked in Iran. Being sanctioned may raise his profile among hard-liners. Writing on Twitter in Farsi earlier Friday, Pompeo asked demonstrators to send the U.S. videos of violence by authorities in the protests to a special channel of the encrypted message app Telegram, widely used among Iran\\'s 80 million people. \"I have asked the Iranian protestors to send us their videos, photos, and information documenting the regime\\'s crackdown on protestors,\" Pompeo followed up in another tweet in English. \"The U.S. will expose and sanction the abuses\". It\\'s unclear what further sanctions America can levy as it has already crippled Iran\\'s crucial oil exports and other industries since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from Tehran\\'s nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018. The U.S. also has sanctioned Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other top-ranking officials. That decision has led Iran to break the accord\\'s enrichment, stockpile and centrifuge limits over months of wider tensions that have seen attacks across the Mideast that the U.S. blames on Tehran. Iran denies being behind many of those assaults, though it claimed shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone and seizing several oil tankers. Starting on Saturday, Iran shut down the internet across the country, limiting communications with the outside world. That made determining the scale and longevity of the protests incredibly difficult. Since Thursday, that outage began to slightly lift. By Friday, internet connectivity stood at around 15% of normal levels, according to the monitoring group NetBlocks. \"Iranians need the real internet back so they can communicate and prosper,\" NetBlocks said. That concern over the shutdown also was reflected in a statement Friday by U.N. human rights experts, who expressed their own alarm about the situation. They said authorities \"may have used excessive force against those participating in the protests\". \"A countrywide network shutdown of this kind clearly has a political purpose: to suppress the right of Iranians to access information and to communicate at a time of rising protest,\" the experts said. \"Such an illegitimate step deprives Iranians not only of a fundamental freedom but also basic access to essential services\". On Friday, the streets of Tehran were quiet, though a heavy presence of anti-riot security forces and police stood guard on the streets. Ebrahim Raisi, the head of Iran\\'s judiciary, warned in a speech in Tehran that consequences await violent demonstrators. \"Those who in recent days misused the atmosphere and the people\\'s demands and concerns, instigated riots in the society, created insecurity, made the hearts of women and children tremble, attacked public property and looted people\\'s belongings, they and their masters must know that a harsh punishment is awaiting them,\" Raisi said. Already, a hard-line newspaper has suggested protest leaders could face executions by hanging. Raisi reportedly served on a so-called death panel during the mass executions of political prisoners in 1988 in Iran after the end of its long war with Iraq. Raisi has never publicly acknowledged his role in the executions, even during his failed presidential campaign in 2017. Meanwhile, the deputy head of Tehran University told the semiofficial ILNA news agency he hoped students detained during campus protests over the fuel price hike will be released Saturday. Several dozen were believed to be held and some already have been released. \"We do not currently know which authority has detained the students,\" Tehran University Vice Chancellor Majid Sarsangi told ILNA. Among those on the streets have been members of Iran\\'s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, whose members and volunteers are answerable only to Khamenei himself. The acting commander of the force, Gen Ali Fadavi, boasted Friday that his force could \"manage the riots within 48 hours,\" the semiofficial Fars news agency close to the Guard said. However, Fadavi offered a warning as well. \"The riots are not the last one and it definitely will happen again in the future,\" he said.

The topic - whether artificial intelligence would do more harm than good - was something each side had a big stake in because both were using the technology to deliver their arguments. Cambridge University, home to the world\\'s oldest debating society, was the setting Thursday night for a demonstration of what the future might hold. IBM\\'s Project Debater, a robot that has already debated humans, was for the first time being pitted against itself, at least in the first round. Artificial intelligence \"will not be able to make a decision that is the morally correct one, because morality is unique to humans,\" the computer system said in a synthetic and vaguely feminine voice. \"It cannot make moral decisions easily and can lead to disasters. AI can cause a lot of harm,\" it continued. Artificial intelligence can only make decisions it has been programmed for and \"it is not possible to program for all scenarios, only humans can\". Then, the machine switched sides, delivering the opposing team\\'s argument. Artificial intelligence \"will be a great advantage as it will free up more time from having to do mundane and repetitive tasks,\" it said, its voice embodied by a blue waveform on a screen set into a two-meter-tall sleek black monolith-like pillar. Audience members at the society, which has hosted notable figures including British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the Dalai Lama, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates over its 200-year history, were spellbound by its first non-human guest. After first pitting the technology against a human last year, IBM challenged it to present opposing arguments, in a display of its latest advances. Unlike its earlier debate, which relied on analyzing a huge trove of newspaper and magazine articles for its replies, researchers this time crowd-sourced contributions from 1,100 Cambridge students and fed the answers to the computer. They wanted to find out, \"Can you use the technology to generate a compelling narrative that will help the decision maker to take a better decision?\" said lead scientist Noam Slonim. The system had to identify which side the crowd-sourced contribution was on, rank the best arguments, filter out spelling mistakes and bad grammar, then present a persuasive five-minute statement — a process IBM said took about a minute. Potential applications for the technology include helping a company or government carry out surveys or gather feedback from clients. The night wasn\\'t totally devoid of humanity. Project Debater quipped, \"Let\\'s move to an issue close to my artificial heart: technology,\" drawing laughter from the crowd. And then human debaters took over in the rebuttal and closing rounds, while also jokingly dubbing the computer \"Debbie\" and \"Cybertronia the All-Knowing\". At the end of the night, audience members sided with the argument that artificial intelligence does more good than harm. Its future is assured, at least for now.

The department, which collects more than $2 billion in taxes each year, expects the transition to be complete by the end of 2021. The new Revenue Information Management System and Granite Tax Connect, its online user portal, launched Oct. 28 for more than 9,000 taxpayers, including those who pay meals and rentals, nursing facility quality assessment and Medicaid enhancement taxes. The taxpayers can file taxes electronically and schedule automated online payments, along with other tasks.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration doesn\\'t give enough direction to companies developing automatous cars, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday. Senators quizzed NHTSA\\'s acting administrator on why the agency hasn\\'t set standards for automatic braking and steering systems that are becoming more common, and why the agency hasn\\'t confronted Tesla about widely shared hacks that let drivers take their hands off the steering wheel. NHTSA\\'s acting administrator, James Owens, told lawmakers that his agency is assessing autonomous vehicle technology and researching how people interact with it. He said, however, that the agency fears it could stifle innovation if it goes too far in regulating technology that is still evolving. The comments at a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee came one day after the transportation safety board blamed a distracted backup driver for letting an autonomous Uber test car strike and kill a pedestrian last year. The board said NHTSA has failed to adequately oversee autonomous-vehicle testing. Board member Jennifer Homendy accused NHTSA of putting technology advancement above saving lives. The safety board recommended that NHTSA require car developers to submit safety reports, and that NHTSA review the plans to make sure the companies have safeguards in place — for instance, to make sure operators are paying attention while the vehicles are moving. Currently those reports are voluntary, and few companies file them — 16 so far, while there are about 80 companies testing autonomous cars, according to safety board Chairman Robert Sumwalt. He said some of those plans are nothing more than marketing brochures. \"The manufacturers are not going to be objective in evaluating their own safety assessments,\" Sumwalt told the senators. \"There needs to be a federal look at these assessments to make sure that they are done properly\". Owens said NHTSA will evaluate the safety board\\'s recommendations. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. , asked Owens whether NHTSA will set minimum safety standards for automatic braking and steering systems. He responded that developers are still improving those systems. \"We will establish safety standards when we determine that the technology is proven,\" Owens said. \"If we establish standards too quickly, we run the risk of stymieing innovation\". NHTSA said it would seek public comment on test procedures to evaluate advanced driving systems such as automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control that keeps drivers a set distance from vehicles in front of them. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., cited a TV news report claiming to show Tesla drivers how to use a water bottle wedged in the steering wheel to trick the car into thinking they have their hands on the wheel, which is required to operate the auto-pilot feature. He wanted to know what NHTSA has done to confront Tesla about countering the purported hack to make sure \"that these cars don\\'t wind up killing people\". Owens was unable to say whether the agency had raised the issue with Tesla. Markey said Tesla should disable auto-pilot until it fixes the problem. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Federal Communications Commission also proposed requiring companies that get government subsidies to rip out any equipment from Huawei and ZTE that they already have in place. It\\'s the latest action by the U.S. government against Chinese tech and telecom companies. The FCC voted unanimously Friday to bar U.S. telecommunications providers from using government subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei or ZTE. The FCC\\'s order mostly affects small, rural companies, as larger U.S. carriers do not use equipment from those Chinese companies. In a statement Saturday, Huawei urged the FCC to reconsider what it called a \"profoundly mistaken\" and \"unlawful order\". It said the decision was \"based on selective information, innuendo, and mistaken assumptions\" and that \"these unwarranted actions will have profound negative effects on connectivity for Americans in rural and underserved areas across the United States\". As for replacing existing equipment, the FCC is asking for comment on how to help rural telecoms financially. Bills in Congress have proposed setting $700 million to $1 billion aside. A trade group for small rural wireless carriers has said that it would cost up to $1 billion for its dozen companies to replace their Huawei and ZTE equipment. It says that Huawei has 40 customers in the U.S. (Huawei is also a member of the trade group, the Rural Wireless Association.) The group said Friday that it was \"cautiously optimistic\" that the FCC\\'s approach would let its companies keep providing services to customers and give them funding to replace any banned equipment. The Huawei statement said the lack of funding would hurt rural and disadvantaged communities. \"Without access to those solutions, these carriers will lose their ability to provide reliable and high-speed telecommunications and internet services,\" it said. \"Rural schools, hospitals, and libraries will feel the effects. And, due to reduced competition in the market for telecommunications equipment, particularly in cutting-edge 5G networks, all Americans will pay higher prices for these critical services\". Huawei reiterated its desire to work with the FCC to lay to rest concerns over national security and ensure \"best practices\" are used in U.S. telecommunications systems. Huawei is the world\\'s biggest supplier of telecom gear as well as a major cellphone manufacturer. The U.S. government has said that Huawei poses an espionage threat, but has presented no evidence of its equipment being used for spying by the Chinese government. The U.S. has been pressuring allies to ban Huawei from their networks and has restricted exports of U.S. technology to Huawei, though numerous loopholes have been exploited. ZTE did not respond to requests for comment Friday. ZTE has also denied that China uses its products for spying. A congressional report in 2012 labeled both Chinese companies as security risks. Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said the FCC\\'s move Friday was a good one, but took too long and did not go far enough. She said there needs to be a \"coordinated national plan\" for securing next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G.The much-hyped unveiling of Tesla\\'s electric pickup truck went off script Thursday night when supposedly unbreakable window glass splintered twice when hit with a large metal ball. The failed stunt, which ranks high on the list of embarrassing auto industry rollouts, came just after CEO Elon Musk bragged about the strength of \"Tesla Armor Glass\" on the wedge-shaped \"Cybertruck\". On a Los Angeles-area stage with Musk, Tesla design chief Franz von Holzhausen hurled a softball-sized metal ball at the driver\\'s side window to demonstrate the strength of the glass, which Musk called \"Transparent Metal Glass\". It shattered. \"Oh my. God,\" Musk said, uttering an expletive. \"Maybe that was a little too hard\". They tried it a second time on the left passenger window, which spider-cracked again. Musk recovered with a one-liner: \"At least it didn\\'t go through. That\\'s a plus side\". The failure overshadowed the truck\\'s slick unveiling, with some analysts panning its looks. The truck, a stainless-steel covered triangle, resembles the much derided Pontiac Aztek SUV sold by General Motors in the early 2000s. Investors apparently didn\\'t like the stunts or the truck\\'s futuristic design, which is aimed at getting a foothold in the most profitable part of the U.S. auto market. Tesla shares fell more than 6% Friday. \"Tesla\\'s Cybertruck reveal will likely disappoint current pickup truck owners, and we see the vehicle remaining a niche and not a mainstream product,\" Cowen Investment Research analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote in a note to investors. \"While we are pleased to see Tesla enter the most profitable segment of the North American passenger car market, we do not see this vehicle in its current form being a success\". Over the years, such stunts have been common at highly rehearsed auto industry unveils. In a tweet Friday, Musk indicated Tesla had rehearsed its stunt as well, saying the same ball was thrown at the same window of the truck before the event and it \"didn\\'t even scratch the glass\". But like Tesla, others have seen some embarrassing mishaps. At Detroit\\'s auto show earlier this year, an Infiniti concept electric SUV missed its introduction when it wouldn\\'t start and the company couldn\\'t move it onto the stage. Perhaps the most famous miscue came in Detroit in 2008 when Chrysler showed off the new Ram pickup truck with a cattle drive outside the convention center. But some of the cattle started mating, drawing attention away from the vehicle. \"You can rehearse it 100 times, and the 101st is the time you do it before the public and it fails,\" said Bud Liebler, who was head of marketing and communications at Chrysler from 1980 through 2001. He was in charge when Chrysler became famous for auto-show stunts, including driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee up the entry steps and through the front windows of Detroit\\'s convention center in the 1990s. Liebler said he considers the Tesla event a \"fiasco,\" but said Musk did the only thing he could when the glass broke. He joked about it and continued on with the show. \"It\\'s got to be an embarrassment,\" Liebler said. With the Cybertruck, Tesla was aiming for Detroit\\'s profit machine, the full-sized pickup. The truck came onstage with lasers and flames, and a demonstration of its stainless steel skin developed by Musk\\'s SpaceX rocket company went well. Von Holzhausen swung a sledge hammer at the driver\\'s side door, and it bounced away harmlessly without any damage. Musk said the Cybertruck will start at $39,900 but a tri-motor, long-range version will have a base price of $69,900. It will have a battery range of between 250 miles (400 kilometers) and more than 500 miles and will be able to tow up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms). Tesla says the truck can go from zero to 60 mph (97 kph) in 2.9 seconds. The electric pickup truck will be in production in 2021, Musk said. With the truck, Tesla is gunning for buyers with fierce brand loyalty. Many pickup truck buyers stick with the same brand for life, choosing a truck based on what their mom or dad drove or what they decided was the toughest model, said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. \"They\\'re very much creatures of habit,\" Gordon said. Getting a loyal Ford F-150 buyer to consider switching to another brand such as a Chevy Silverado, \"it\\'s like asking him to leave his family,\" he said. Tesla\\'s pickup is more likely to appeal to weekend warriors who want an electric vehicle that can handle some outdoor adventure. And it could end up cutting into Tesla\\'s electric vehicle sedan sales instead of winning over traditional pickup truck drivers. \"The needs-based truck buyer, the haulers, the towers at the worksites of the world, that\\'s going to be a much tougher sell,\" said Akshay Anand, executive analyst at Kelley Blue Book. The truck will help Musk enter a new market, but it\\'s not likely to make a bunch of money for the company. Instead, Tesla will rely on its mainstream Model 3 sedan and the upcoming Model Y small SUV due to go on sale in early 2021. Musk stands to face competition when his truck hits the market. Ford, which has long dominated the pickup truck landscape, plans to launch an all-electric F-150 pickup. General Motors CEO Mary Barra said its battery-electric pickup will come out by the fall of 2021. Rivian, a startup based near Detroit, plans to begin production in the second half of 2020 on an electric pickup that starts at $69,000 and has a battery range of 400-plus miles (640 kilometers). Tesla has struggled to meet delivery targets for its sedans, and some fear the new vehicle will shift the company\\'s attention away from the goal of more consistently meeting its targets.

Artificial intelligence is spreading into health care, often as software or a computer program capable of learning from large amounts of data and making predictions to guide care or help patients. It already detects an eye disease tied to diabetes and does other behind-the-scenes work like helping doctors interpret MRI scans and other imaging tests for some forms of cancer. Now, parts of the health system are starting to use it directly with patients. During some clinic and telemedicine appointments, AI-powered software asks patients initial questions about their symptoms that physicians or nurses normally pose. And an AI program featuring a talking image of the Greek philosopher Aristotle is starting to help University of Southern California students cope with stress. Researchers say this push into medicine is at an early stage, but they expect the technology to grow by helping people stay healthy, assisting doctors with tasks and doing more behind-the-scenes work. They also think patients will get used to AI in their care just like they\\'ve gotten accustomed to using the technology when they travel or shop. But they say there are limits. Even the most advanced software has yet to master important parts of care like a doctor\\'s ability to feel compassion or use common sense. \"Our mission isn\\'t to replace human beings where only human beings can do the job,\" said University of Southern California research professor Albert Rizzo. Rizzo and his team have been working on a program that uses AI and a virtual reality character named \"Ellie\" that was originally designed to determine whether veterans returning from a deployment might need therapy. Ellie appears on computer monitors and leads a person through initial questions. Ellie makes eye contact, nods and uses hand gestures like a human therapist. It even pauses if the person gives a short answer, to push them to say more. \"After the first or second question, you kind of forget that it\\'s a robot,\" said Cheyenne Quilter, a West Point cadet helping to test the program. Ellie does not diagnose or treat. Instead, human therapists used recordings of its sessions to help determine what the patient might need. \"This is not AI trying to be your therapist,\" said another researcher, Gale Lucas. \"This is AI trying to predict who is most likely to be suffering\". The team that developed Ellie also has put together a newer AI-based program to help students manage stress and stay healthy. Ask Ari is making its debut at USC this semester to give students easy access to advice on dealing with loneliness, getting better sleep or handling other complications that crop up in college life. Ari does not replace a therapist, but its designers say it will connect students through their phones or laptops to reliable help whenever they need it. USC senior Jason Lewis didn\\'t think the program would have much for him when he helped test it because he wasn\\'t seeking counseling. But he found that Ari covered many topics he could relate to, including information on how social media affects people. \"Everybody thinks they are alone in their thoughts and problems,\" he said. \"Ari definitely counters that isolation\". Aside from addressing mental health needs, artificial intelligence also is at work in more common forms of medicine. The tech company AdviNOW Medical and 98point6, which provides treatment through secure text messaging, both use artificial intelligence to question patients at the beginning of an appointment. AdviNOW CEO James Bates said their AI program decides what questions to ask and what information it needs. It passes that information and a suggested diagnosis to a physician who then treats the patient remotely through telemedicine. The company currently uses the technology in a handful of Safeway and Albertsons grocery store clinics in Arizona and Idaho. But it expects to expand to about 1,000 clinics by the end of next year. Eventually, the company wants to have AI diagnose and treat some minor illnesses, Bates said. Researchers say much of AI\\'s potential for medicine lies in what it can do behind the scenes by examining large amounts of data or images to spot problems or predict how a disease will develop, sometimes quicker than a doctor. Future uses might include programs like one that hospitals currently use to tell doctors which patients are more likely to get sepsis, said Darren Dworkin, chief information officer at California\\'s Cedars-Sinai medical center. Those warnings can help doctors prevent the deadly illness or treat it quickly. \"It\\'s basically that little tap on the shoulder that we all want to get of, \\'Hey, perhaps you should look over here,\\'\" Dworkin said. Dr. Eric Topol predicts in his book \"Deep Medicine\" that artificial intelligence will change medicine, in part by freeing doctors to spend more time with patients. But he also notes that the technology will not take over care. Even the most advanced program cannot replicate empathy, Topol said. Patients stick to their treatment and prescriptions more and do better if they know their doctor is pulling for them. Artificial intelligence also can\\'t process everything a doctor considers when deciding on treatment, noted Harvard Medical School\\'s Dr. Isaac Kohane. That might include a patient\\'s tolerance for pain or the desire to live a few more months to attend a child\\'s wedding or graduation. \"Good doctors are the ones who understand us and our goals as human beings,\" he said.

(AP) — Alex Caldwell hit a 3-point field goal with 17 seconds left in the game to lift Southeast Missouri State to a 72-71 win over Division II-Missouri Science and Technology on Friday night. Caldwell tied the game at 69-69 with a hard drive to the hoop, but after a Missouri S&T time out, Dulan Scott broke the tie with 34 seconds left when he knocked down a jumper to put the Miners ahead. Looking to take the last shot, the Redhawks had the ball stolen away with 3.4 seconds left, but Missouri S&T\\'s Mitch Fairless missed a jump shot as time expired. Sage Tolbert scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds to lead the Redhawks (2-2). Caldwell, who hit 2 of 3 from distance, added 12 points. Fairless scored 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Missouri S&T. Scott added 18 points. SE Missouri State heads to Fresno, where it will take on Cal State-Fullerton in the Cable Car Classic tournament on Wednesday.TROY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama researchers are studying new ways to recycle plastics. Troy University says its recently established Center for Material and Manufacturing Sciences has received a $2.7 million grant to look at new methods of recycling plastic waste. A statement from the school says the money will pay for scientists and students to work on the project, plus equipment to do the work. The grant is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is part of the U.S. Commerce Department. It provided another grant of $3.2 million last year. The research looks at ways to recycle polymers into new materials. Researchers will also study using hemp fiber to reinforce plastics and ways to test recycled material.BEIJING (AP) — China issued new, tougher guidelines for protection of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property in a move that may be timed to help along halting progress in trade talks with the United States. The guidelines issued late Sunday by the State Council, or Cabinet, and by the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party order beefed up laws for protecting such intellectual property rights, increased compensation for infringements and stricter enforcement of existing laws. They also lower the threshold for criminal prosecution of IPR offenses. The new blueprint makes protection of intellectual property one of the criteria for evaluating local government officials\\' performance, creating a greater incentive for compliance. In past decades, officials were judged mainly by political loyalties and economic growth in their localities. More recently, China\\'s leaders added environmental protection to such evaluations. Putting future promotions and income on the line could create much stronger motivation to more effectively enforce such laws. Theft and forced transfers of technology and inadequate protection of copyrights, patents and trademarks are perennial complaints of foreign companies operating in China and are among the key issues in the latest flareup in trade tensions. Despite much progress, \"China continues to be a haven for counterfeiting, digital piracy and IP theft,\" the U.S. government\\'s International Trade Administration said in a recent report. It said piracy of U.S. intellectual piracy by China costs American companies up to $600 billion a year. Piracy is also a domestic concern. The government has long said that companies are less likely to innovate if they cannot profit off the results of their investments due to piracy of their products and technology. The IPR guidelines issued by the official Xinhua News Agency did not refer specifically to the trade talks. Improving those protections is the \"The driver of our country\\'s economic competitiveness,\" it said. The new rules call for \"greatly increasing the maximum amount of compensation for damages linked to IPR infringements\" and include confiscation of illegal income, destruction of counterfeit goods. The guidelines did not include specific penalties, which would come with later revisions of laws and regulations. They call for significantly improving the enforcement of IPR protections by 2022. Hopes for progress in resolving the costly trade dispute between the U.S. and China have revived in recent days with upbeat comments from both sides. President Donald Trump said Friday at an NCAA National Collegiate Champions Day event that the \"China deal is coming along very well\". He also suggested that he might not sign a congressional resolution in support of human rights in Hong Kong following months of protests, out of concern that might derail the trade talks. A desire to keep those negotiations on track was a factor deterring China from intervening in the turmoil, he asserted. Asked Monday about the status of the trade talks, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman reiterated Beijing\\'s stance that it hopes to reach an agreement based on \"mutual respect\". \"We hope the U.S. side will meet us halfway,\" said Geng Shuang. Asked about a decision Friday by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to cut off government funding for equipment from two Chinese companies on grounds of national security, Geng said it would not improve U.S. national security. The FCC has proposed requiring companies that get government subsidies to rip out any equipment from Huawei and ZTE that they already have in place. \"I would like to admonish certain people in the U.S. that if they lock all the doors on the pretext of security, in the end, they will find themselves locked out of the world,\" Geng said.BOSTON (AP) — The first cargo-carrying robot marketed directly to consumers is on sale this holiday season. But how many people are ready to ditch their second car to buy a two-wheeled rover that can follow them around like a dog. Corporate giants like Amazon, FedEx and Ford have already been experimenting with sending delivery robots to doorsteps. Now Piaggio, the Italian company that makes the Vespa scooter, is offering a stylish alternative to those blandly utilitarian machines — albeit one that weighs 50 pounds (23 kilograms) and costs $3,250. It\\'s named the Gita (JEE\\'-tah) after the Italian word for a short, pleasurable excursion — the kind you might take to pick up some lacinato kale and gourmet cheese at the farmers market. Its creators have such trips in mind for the \"hands-free carrier\" that can hold produce and other objects as it follows its owner down a sidewalk. \"We\\'re trying to get you out into the world and connected to that neighborhood you decided to move to because it was so walkable,\" said Greg Lynn, CEO of Piaggio\\'s tech-focused subsidiary, Piaggio Fast Forward. Tech industry analysts are already declaring the Gita as doomed to fail unless it finds a more practical application, such as lugging tools around warehouses, hospitals or factory floors. \"That\\'s a lot of money for what is in effect just a cargo-carrying robot that\\'s going to carry your groceries,\" said Forrester technology analyst J.P. Gownder. On a recent November morning, Lynn was hunched over in a Boston waterfront park, pushing a button that triggered a Gita to \"see\" him with its cameras and sensors. Then came a musical whirring sound as the device — a squarish, bright red bucket with two oversized wheels — rose up and signaled it was ready for a neighborhood stroll. A young boy in a stroller pointed excitedly. Another pedestrian asked to try it, and playfully shouted \"ah!\" as it swerved around, keeping in pursuit as she switched directions. The Gita doesn\\'t require a phone or intrusive people-tracking technology such as facial recognition or GPS. \"It basically just locks onto you and tracks you,\" said Piaggio Fast Forward\\'s other co-founder, Jeffrey Schnapp. Other startups like Starship Technologies have a more conventional business plan for their own delivery robots. The company charges a delivery fee starting at $1.99 if you order its rovers to bring you a Starbucks coffee or a lunch from Panda Express. So far, the best habitat to find Starship\\'s six-wheelers are relatively confined spaces such as college campuses; the University of Houston and the University of Wisconsin-Madison rolled them out this fall. The robots, which look like oversized ice chests on wheels, can carry up to 20 pounds (9 kilograms). \"I love them. I think they\\'re so cute!\" University of Houston freshman Sadie Garcia said as one of the machines rolled up with a bagel sandwich she\\'d ordered. She said she was so cold she didn\\'t want to leave her dorm. Starship co-founder Ahti Heinla said his San Francisco startup once looked at selling the machines directly to consumers, but dropped the idea after realizing it would have to price them at more than $3,000. Amazon is experimenting with a similar-looking machine that delivers retail goods in a handful of U.S. neighborhoods. FedEx is testing its own delivery rover in partnership with Pizza Hut, Walmart, Target and Walgreens. Ford has showed off a gangly two-legged robot to carry items to homes. So far, none are as far along as Starship, which has hundreds of its machines already in service. While Forrester\\'s Gownder isn\\'t impressed with the Gita, he\\'s bullish about delivery robots of the Starship variety because their autonomy will help save labor costs. Gownder said it\\'s more of a question of whether ground-based rovers or aerial delivery drones will prove more successful. The wheeled cargo robots that have already made it out into the wild have significant limitations. Starship\\'s machines still require plenty of manual supervision to load them with food orders. They rely on remote pilots to troubleshoot navigation problems. Customers also have to check a phone app to tell the vehicle where to go and to unlock the bin once it arrives. The Gita, meanwhile, might still be impractical for many people. It favors paved environments that are dense enough to have stores in walking distance, but not so dense that the machines get lost in the crowd. And anyone who is simply looking to pull home groceries without heavy lifting can find durable wagons online for less than $100. Associated Press video journalists John L. Mone in Houston and Rodrique Ngowi in Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributed to this report.SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The survey-software provider Qualtrics is planning to expand its Provo-based headquarters, add jobs and build an on-site daycare center that will focus on science, math, engineering and technology. Qualtrics International Inc. said in a news release Thursday the expansion will double the size of the offices when it opens in the spring of 2021. The company plans to add 1,000 new jobs over five years. The daycare facility is scheduled to open in the fall of 2020 across the street. It will offer a STEM-focused curriculum for children up to 5-years-old of employees who pay for the service. A year ago, SAP paid $8 billion to acquire Qualtrics. Qualtrics has announced plans for new office buildings in Seattle, Chicago and Dublin, Ireland.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is making it harder for political advertisers to target specific types of people. The company said that as of January, advertisers will only be able to target U.S. political ads based on broad categories such as gender, age and postal code. Currently, ads can be tailored for more specific groups — for instance, using information gleaned from public voter logs, such as political affiliation. The change will take effect in the UK in the next week, before the general election, and in the European Union before the end of 2019. It will apply everywhere else in early January. Google reiterated that ads making false claims are prohibited, adding that so-called deepfakes — realistic but false video clips — are not allowed. Neither are \"demonstrably false\" claims that could affect voter trust in an election. But in a blog post announcing the news, Google Ads vice president Scott Spencer noted that political dialogue is important and \"no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim and insinuation\". \"So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited — but we will continue to do so for clear violations,\" he wrote. Like all Google ads, political advertisers can also use the broader practice of \"contextual targeting,\" which involves placing ads about, say, climate change on articles about the environment. The company is also requiring advertiser verification for a broader range of political messages. Previously, only ads mentioning candidates or officeholders for federal positions required verification. Now that will also include ads touching on state officials and candidates as well as ballot measures. The move follows Twitter\\'s ban on political ads, which goes into effect on Friday. Twitter also placed restrictions on ads related to social causes such as climate change or abortion. In these instances, advertisers won\\'t be able to target those ads down to a user\\'s ZIP code or use political categories such as \"conservative\" or \"liberal\". Rather, targeting must be kept broad, based on a user\\'s state or province, for instance. Facebook has not made sweeping changes to any of its ads policies, but thrust the issue into public discussion this fall when it confirmed it would not remove false or misleading ads by politicians. Critics have harshly condemned Facebook\\'s decision. Twitter also faced a backlash from those who found its ban too far-reaching. Google has taken a more middling stance, but it\\'s unlikely to please everyone. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump\\'s campaign staff took issue with reports that Facebook might consider limiting its targeting practices. \"Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020,\" the campaign tweeted from its official account. \"Tools that help us reach more great Americans & lift voices the media & big tech choose to ignore!\". Even Google\\'s limited targeting could receive backlash. Critics and civil rights groups have said targeting specific zip codes or other small geographic zones can allow advertisers to discriminate or sway elections. The expansion to Google\\'s verification process will take effect December 3. AP Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The deception was easy to pull off and came with barely any consequences. Britain\\'s Conservative Party changed the name of its press office\\'s Twitter account to \"factcheckUK\" during a televised election debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn this week. The renaming made the account look like a neutral fact-checker, raising new concerns about all the creative ways groups and individuals can use social media to deceive voters. The party hardly even got a slap on the wrist, as Twitter pledged to take \"decisive corrective action\" only if the Conservatives try to mislead people again. The incident occurred after years of promises, new rules and millions of dollars spent by social media companies to prevent election interference following Russia\\'s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. It shows that whatever steps tech companies have taken, users will continue to look for ways to exploit loopholes, unevenly enforced or nonexistent policies and companies\\' fears of appearing partisan in their crackdowns. \"This is dirty tricks and should be dealt with mercilessly,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who covers social media. \"It shows how difficult it is for social media to police tricks like these\". In one tweet, the Conservative Party account posted a short video with the words \"factcheckUK verdict,\" declaring Johnson the winner of the debate. The renamed account still carried the blue checkmark reserved for \"verified\" Twitter users. It\\'s not clear if large swaths of people were misled by the fake fact-checking account. Plenty of Twitter users called out the deception while it was happening. The Conservative Party changed only the name that appeared at the top of the account, not the actual username that comes after the \"at\" symbol. Anyone who took a closer look could still see who the tweets were coming from. Twitter declined to answer questions Wednesday on whether it is rethinking its policies to prevent similar incidents and why it didn\\'t suspend the offending account. Twitter users can easily change their account names. This is popular around Halloween, when people temporarily adopt spooky monikers. While impersonation is technically against Twitter\\'s policies, the rules don\\'t apply to parody accounts. There is no specific rule on Twitter against calling yourself a fact-checker, even if you\\'re peddling anything but facts. As for Twitter\\'s bigger rival Facebook, it is unclear if there\\'s anything to stop a verified group from changing its name on the social network to something like TheTruthUK or FactCheckUSA. While Facebook bars impersonating the official account of a brand or a public figure, its rules are silent on names that merely describe the account\\'s intent. Some journalists fear that sites that co-opt the phrase \"fact check\" to make political points could cause the term to lose its meaning. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the party\\'s actions, saying the Twitter account was clearly linked to the Conservatives and asserting that voters would not be perturbed by \"the social media cut and thrust\". \"We make no apology for having an instant rebuttal to all the nonsense and lies put out,\" Raab told the BBC. Twitter, long known for its freewheeling and public nature, has said in the past that it cares \"deeply\" about misinformation and its \"potentially harmful effect on the civic and political discourse that is core to our mission\". But it does not offer third-party fact checks like Facebook. Nor does it ban misinformation save for a few specific cases, such as instances in which people are being told the wrong time or place to vote. Twitter cannot check every single tweet for accuracy. Instead, the company said in a 2017 blog post, its \"open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information\". Even so, the company recently banned all political ads, calling it an important step in reducing the flow of election-related misinformation. But the policy does not apply to the myriad other ways misinformation can be spread. Tim Bajarin, president of consultancy Creative Strategies, said that while the misleading name change happened in Britain, both major parties in the U.S. will probably \"go to school on how this works and how Twitter responds to this\". AP Technology Writer Mae Anderson contributed to this story from New York.Amnesty International issued a scathing indictment of the world\\'s dominant internet corporations, arguing in a new report that Google and Facebook should be forced to abandon what it calls their surveillance-based business model because it is \"predicated on human rights abuse\". The London-based global rights group said in the 60-page report published Thursday that the business model of what it calls the \"Surveillance Giants\" is \"inherently incompatible with the right to privacy\". Google and Facebook likewise threaten a range of other rights, including freedom expression and the right to equality and non-discrimination, the group said. The report said the company\\'s practice of vacuuming up personal data in order to feed voracious advertising businesses represents an unprecedented assault on privacy rights. It says the companies force people to make a \"Faustian bargain\" to share their data in order to access Google and Facebook services that have grown to dominate the global public square. \"This ubiquitous surveillance has undermined the very essence of the right to privacy,\" the report said, adding that the companies\\' \"use of algorithmic systems to create and infer detailed profiles on people interferes with our ability to shape our own identities within a private sphere\". Amnesty called on governments to legally guarantee people\\'s right not to be tracked by advertisers or other third parties. It called current regulations — and the companies\\' own privacy-shielding measures — inadequate. In a written five-page response published with the report, Facebook disagreed with its conclusion that the company\\'s business practices \"are inconsistent with human rights principles\". Steve Satterfield, Facebook\\'s public policy director, also disputed that the social media behemoth\\'s business model is \"surveillance-based\" and noted that users sign up voluntarily for the service, which is nominally free although data collected is used to sell ads. \"A person\\'s choice to use Facebook\\'s services, and the way we collect, receive or use data — all clearly disclosed and acknowledged by users — cannot meaningfully be likened to the involuntary (and often unlawful) government surveillance\" described in international human rights law, the letter states. Google did not offer an on-the-record response to the report but disputed its findings. Amnesty said the company provided input and publicly available documents.REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — \"Hi, I hope you are not busy?\". The treasurer of the Icelandic soccer club Afturelding got the email from his manager late in the afternoon, soon before banks were about to close. The words \"Sent from my iPhone\" were at the bottom, suggesting urgency, and through a series of exchanges, the manager asked that a quick payment be made. It was a scam, perpetrated from someone posing as the club manager - and part of a sudden rush of online fraud that is catching Icelanders unprepared. Online apps have now become good at translating the country\\'s complex language, a version of Old Norse spoken only by about 400,000 people. And the government has lifted limits on money transfers out of the country that had been imposed since the financial crisis. The combination over the past two years has attracted scammers to target a population that has not developed the same habits of caution about online fraud as other such wealthy, high-tech countries. \"The trick is always the same, but the Icelandic gets better and better,\" said Audur Thorsteinsdóttir, manager of The Icelandic Youth Association, an umbrella organization regularly warning member clubs against fraud emails. Large and small enterprises, from vehicle inspection companies to residents\\' associations, have been shaken this year by someone posing as the CEO or chairman seeking a swift payment. By using Google Translate or Microsoft\\'s Translator - the two apps that can translate Icelandic - the criminals were able to sound credible, police say. Known as \"CEO fraud\" - when criminals pose as high-ranking executives after thoroughly researching the company structure - the scams did not exist at Icelandic workplaces in the early days of online translators. Software offered poor, often comically inaccurate, results: Icelandic for \"youth\" for example, was translated as meaning \"Youtube\". The apps have since improved. \"The text has the kind of errors Google Translate makes,\" such as awkward capitalization and syntax, said police detective Dadi Gunnarsson. \"But it reads remarkably well, and that fools many\". Recent scams have amounted to the largest thefts the island nation has ever seen. Geothermal energy company HS Orka recently lost $1.5 million and a total of $13 million has been lost to foreign scammers over the past twelve months, the police estimate. In another case, a series of promoted ads on social media promised to explain how to bounce back from bankruptcy. The link brought users to a website mimicking a respected business paper, with its trademark pink background. It was a bitcoin scheme meant to defraud. Icelandic was introduced to Google Translate in 2009, earlier than many other more widely spoken languages as a Reykjavík-born employee at the tech company wanted his mother tongue included as soon as possible. Dozens of students and faculty at Reykjavík University volunteered to help Google gather samples for voice recognition. Still, the translations were incomplete and spotty for many years. \"The learning curve has been steep for Iceland,\" said Morten Tandle, director of the Nordic Financial Cert, a Norway-based organization coordinating cyber security responses between large companies in the region. Experts say that as artificial intelligence improved, translation apps only really became good enough at Icelandic around 2018. That was just months after the government removed limits on the amount of money that could be transferred out of the country that had been imposed since the financial crisis over a decade ago. It was like foreign scammers had been waiting for the day, police said. Cases of online fraud began piling up, with the number this year about six times higher than the year before, according to Landsbankinn, a large commercial bank. Victims rarely get their money back. In most countries, Tandle said, people learn to be cautious online because someone around them has been scammed or hurt by messages with malicious software. The country\\'s isolation from such trends until recently made its sudden exposure all the more painful. The rule of thumb, experts advise, is to always respond to financial inquiries through a different medium, like replying to an email with a phone call. Icelanders pride themselves on their sense of community and have one of the highest levels of \"social trust\" in surveys measuring people\\'s belief in each other and in honesty and integrity. \"Social trust is the desired quality of every society,\" said Gunnar Helgi Kristinsson, a politics professor at the University of Iceland. \"It makes the economy more dynamic, democracy stronger and people happier and healthier - in academic literature nothing bad is ever associated with healthy trust\". Yet police and cybersecurity experts note that online scammers successfully exploit it and are urging more caution. \"Digitalization of finance and public service needs to be followed by more awareness,\" said Jarno Limnéll, a professor in cybersecurity at the Aalto University in Finland. \"We should approach the internet like driving: Always on the alert\". Kristján Ásgeirsson, a fishing industry entrepreneur known as Fiskikóngurinn, \"the King of Fish,\" made a splash in local media recently speaking about the shame and distrust he felt after falling for a scam. Ásgeirsson received an email from what appeared to be a trusted American business associate asking for the next invoice to be paid to a separate account for tax purposes. Someone had hacked Ásgeirsson\\'s inbox and was posing as his contact under a false email address. He lost $68,000 and only discovered the scam weeks later. \"I felt like a complete idiot,\" Ásgeirsson said. \"It can happen to everyone,\" he added, before pausing and revising his statement: \"It is happening to everyone\". For all of AP\\'s tech coverage, visit: https://apnews.com/apf-technology.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio has used a new data tool to identify dozens of duplicate payments made by state government offices since the start of the year. A pilot review of InnovateOhio Platform technologies found 56 erroneous payments by 22 different state agencies, boards and commissions from January through September. They totaled nearly $118,000. Jon Husted oversees state technology initiatives through InnovateOhio. He said the pilot review conducted by the Office of Budget and Management shows how it\\'s possible to save money and make government more efficient by centralizing data through the technology office. \"Now that we\\'re putting this data on the InnovateOhio Platform, we can just apply our analytics tools to it and do this really easily,\" Husted said. The Republican official said it\\'s difficult for human review to find errors amid the state\\'s 18 million transactions a year, and that modern data tools and methods are a big help. \"We just won\\'t have these mistakes anymore, and who knows over the time of all state government just how much that adds up to?\" Husted said. \"Over the course of times, it\\'s millions of dollars\". The offices where duplicates were identified are working to recover overpayments, and the state budget office plans to repeat the review of payment data monthly.World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee released an ambitious rule book for online governance — a bill of rights and obligations for the internet — designed to counteract the growing prevalence of such anti-democratic poisons as misinformation, mass surveillance and censorship. The product of a year\\'s work by the World Wide Web Foundation where Berners-Lee is a founding director, the \" Contract for the Web \" seeks commitments from governments and industry to make and keep knowledge freely available — a digital policy agenda true to the design vision of the 30-year-old web. The contract is non-binding, however. And funders and partners in the endeavor include Google and Facebook, whose data-collecting business models and sensation-rewarding algorithms have been blamed for exacerbating online toxicity. \"We haven\\'t had a fairly complex, fairly complete plan of action for the web going forward,\" Berners-Lee said in an interview. \"This is the first time we\\'ve had a rule book in which responsibility is being shared\". For instance, the contract proposes a framework for protecting online privacy and personal data with clearly defined national laws that give individuals greater control over the data collected about them. Independent, well-resourced regulators would offer the public effective means for redress. Current laws and institutions don\\'t measure up to that standard. Amnesty International just released a report charging that Google and Facebook\\'s business models are predicated on the abuse of human rights. Berners-Lee nevertheless says that \"having them in the room is really important\". He said both companies had approached the foundation seeking participation. \"We feel that companies and governments deserve equal seats at the table and understanding where they\\'re coming from is equally valuable,\" he said. \"To have this conversation around a table without the tech companies, it just wouldn\\'t have the clout and we wouldn\\'t have ended up with the insights\". The nonprofit foundation\\'s top donors include the Swedish, Canadian and U.S. governments and the Ford and Omidyar foundations. One of its biggest challenges is the growing balkanization of the internet, with national governments led by China, Russia and Iran exerting increasing technical control over their domestic networks, tightening censorship and surveillance. \"The trend for balkanization is really worrying and it\\'s extreme at the moment in Iran,\" said Berners-Lee. A strong government exhibits tolerance, the computer scientist added, for \"other voices, opposition voices, foreign voices to be heard by its citizens\". So how to prevent governments from restricting internet access at their borders. One approach, said Berners-Lee, could be financial pressure. Multinational lenders could condition lower interest rates, for example, on a nation\\'s willingness to let information flow freely on its domestic network.NEW YORK (AP) — Uber will allow passengers and drivers in Brazil and Mexico to record audio of their rides as it attempts to improve its safety record and image. The ride-hailing company plans to pilot the feature in cities in both countries in December. It eventually hopes to launch it in other markets, including the United States, although it has no timeline for possible expansion. The feature will allow customers to opt into recording all or select trips. Recordings will be stored on the rider or driver\\'s phone and encrypted to protect privacy, and users will not be able to listen to them. They can later share a recording with Uber, which will have an encryption key, if they want to report a problem. Whether the recording feature will deter violent behavior to help riders and drivers is unknown. But Uber stands to benefit because the recordings could help the company mitigate losses and reign in liability for incidents that flare up between drivers and passengers. For example, if a shouting match erupts between a driver and passenger, and both accuse the other of being verbally abusive, the recording could help Uber determine where fault lies after the incident, mitigating any kind of loss or claim that could be made against the driver, said Thom Rickert, vice president and emerging risk specialist at Trident Public Risk Solutions. \"It probably is not going to prevent something from happening,\" Rickert said. \"It will probably just help you analyze what can we do to change outcomes the next time\". Uber says the new feature will promote accountability and help its safety team take decisive action when needed. The recording feature also raises privacy concerns that drivers or passengers could have their conversations recorded without their knowledge or consent. \"It\\'s a digital recording. It\\'s going to exist on a server somewhere,\" Rickert said. \"Yes, it can be encrypted. Yes, it can be hacked. so that is a privacy concern for the individual that has lost control over that recording\". Uber has struggled with safety issues and faced accusations that some of its drivers have assaulted and raped passengers. It also has been hit with litigation alleging that its hiring process and background checks are inadequate. Uber does not conduct fingerprint-based background checks, which traditional taxi companies generally perform before hiring drivers. The San Francisco-based company\\'s drivers also have been victims of attacks. In both Brazil and Mexico, Uber allows riders to pay with cash, which increases the risk of incidents. In Brazil, drivers have been robbed and have suffered violent, fatal attacks while using the Uber platform, the company said in a federal filing. Uber plans to release a safety report this year, which provides data on reports of sexual assaults and other safety incidents that occurred in the United States. The company has been adding safety features to its app over the past year, including one that helps riders ensure they\\'re getting into the right vehicle and another that enables users to call 9-1-1 from within the app and automatically share the vehicle\\'s location with first responders.NEW YORK (AP) — At another time in history, the indictment of two jail guards responsible for monitoring Jeffrey Epstein the night he killed himself might have served as an emphatic rebuttal to suspicions that the wealthy sex offender was actually murdered. Not in 2019. Conspiracy theories continued to flourish, even after prosecutors took pains to point out the ample evidence backing a medical examiner\\'s determination that Epstein hanged himself. Video surveillance confirmed, they said in a news release and an indictment, that nobody had entered the area where Epstein was locked in his cell. The locked door to the unit, they said, could only be opened remotely by an officer in the jail\\'s control center, plus there was a second locked door to which only correctional officers assigned to the high-security housing unit had the key. Epstein had no roommate, they said, and had died alone. Social media buzzed with \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself\" memes, fueled by the financier\\'s past associations with Britain\\'s Prince Andrew and U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. \"People aren\\'t buying the suicide story,\" said one tweet. \"Epstein is alive on a beach somewhere in the middle east,\" said another. Democrats and Republicans — and even Epstein\\'s family and his alleged victims — were united in skepticism that Epstein could have taken his own life a month after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. At a news conference Thursday, lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents several women who say they were sexually abused by Epstein, said there remains quite a few \"suspicious circumstances surrounding his death\". Dr. Michael Baden, the forensic pathologist hired by Epstein\\'s family to observe his autopsy, also remains incredulous, saying he wanted to hear from the guards before deciding whether it was suicide or homicide. Eric Oliver, a University of Chicago professor who studies conspiracy theories, said no amount of evidence presented by government authorities is likely to change some people\\'s minds. \"When there\\'s already this kind of profound mistrust of the political system, of political institutions, of the media, any kind of official channel that seeks to overturn this belief is likely to be viewed with suspicion,\" he said. Oliver said a survey he conducted two weeks ago found that 30% of respondents believed Epstein\\'s death was a homicide. Most conspiracy theories gain traction with less than 20% of respondents, he said. The Trump-perpetuated theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S. peaked at about 24%. The Epstein conspiracy theories also cut across the ideological spectrum, Oliver said, in part because they speak to concerns some Americans have about concentrations of wealth and power: feeling that the wealthy have amassed too much political power. \"The idea that somehow or another they were able to sneak into his jail cell and murder him speaks to both that power — that they\\'re somehow or another above the law — and the nefariousness of their intentions, that they\\'d be willing to murder some guy who could potentially expose the wealthy,\" Oliver said. The two corrections officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center charged in connection with Epstein\\'s Aug. 10 death are accused of the relatively mundane crime of falsifying prison logs. Guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas were supposed to be checking on Epstein every half-hour. But prosecutors said they shirked that duty and were instead sleeping or surfing the internet for bargains on furniture and motorcycles, and Epstein \"committed suicide overnight while unobserved\". The guards have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail. Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press this week that he initially had his own suspicions about Epstein\\'s death but came to the conclusion that failures by the jail\\'s staff had allowed Epstein to take his own life. \"I can understand people who immediately, whose minds went to sort of the worst-case scenario because it was a perfect storm of screw-ups,\" Barr said. The phrase \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself\" has taken on a life of its own — sometimes more as a pop culture catchphrase than an actual belief. It has shown up on a screen at San Diego\\'s airport, on a California brewery\\'s beer cans and as the name of a new Michigan brew. This month, a former Navy SEAL appearing on Fox News blurted, \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself,\" during an unrelated interview. Last week, a man tried to register for a spot on the New Hampshire primary ballot as Rod \"Epstein Didn\\'t Kill Himself\" Webber. On Monday, the day before the officers were charged, a woman who says Epstein sexually assaulted her when she was 15 wore a bracelet to a news conference that spelled out: \"Epstein didn\\'t kill himself\". Even members of Congress got in on the act. U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., spelled out the phrase with the first letter of each in a series of 23 tweets last week. At a prison oversight hearing on Tuesday, U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said drywall, Christmas ornaments and Epstein were \"three things that don\\'t hang themselves\". \"That\\'s what the American people think, and they deserve some answers,\" the Louisiana Republican said. Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, the new director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said during that oversight hearing that Epstein\\'s death was \"a black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons\". But in an exchange with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, she reiterated that it was a suicide. \"Do you have any evidence to suggest otherwise?\" Graham asked. \"I do not,\" Hawk Sawyer said. Associated Press reporter Michael Balsamo contributed to this report from Kalispell, Montana. Follow Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak.SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — When she was first elected to the California state Assembly, Ling Ling Chang publicly posted her cellphone number to get feedback from her constituents. It worked, but it came with a dark side effect: unwanted nude photos from strangers. Exposing yourself on the street is a crime, but the law is less clear when it happens in the digital realm. Earlier this year, Texas outlawed sending unwanted nude photos to people through dating apps or other digital means, making it a Class C misdemeanor with a fine of up to $500. Now Chang, who has since been elected to the state Senate, wants to make that act illegal in California. The senator announced Thursday that she was partnering with the dating app Bumble to introduce legislation in January when state lawmakers return to work. \"I\\'d say 95% of the women I have talked to have experienced something like this,\" said Chang, a Republican whose district includes portions of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. \"We have to send a message that this culture of online harassment must go\". A survey by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found 21% of women ages 18 to 29 have reported being sexually harassed online compared to 9% of men in that same age group. About 53% of those women said they had been sent unwanted explicit photos. Like most states, California outlaws \"revenge porn\". But that law applies to when someone posts a nude photo online of someone else with the intent \"to cause emotional distress\". California also outlaws stalking using electronic devices such as cellphones, but the law does not specifically address unwanted nude or lewd photos. In 2017, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law requiring online dating apps to post safety tips, including ways to report concerns. Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd worked to get the Texas law passed earlier this year. She called these unsolicited lewd photos \"harassment, plain and simple\". \"It\\'s a gateway to more extreme forms of harassment and abuse and it should not be taken lightly, and it deserves consequences,\" she said. Bumble says it has 80 million users worldwide. It is like other dating apps, but it only allows women to initiate conversations with potential partners. The company says this eliminates most unwanted, aggressive behavior from men toward women. In an interview, Herd acknowledged unwanted lewd photos still happen, but said it is not limited to Bumble and is an issue across the digital landscape. She noted it\\'s also a problem for women whose cellphone settings allow for unsolicited messages from others nearby. Earlier this year, Bumble was one of several dating apps to begin using artificial intelligence to detect nude photos. The app will blur the images and give the recipient a chance to view it or delete it. Users can also report the person who sent it. After getting the law passed in Texas, Herd said she wanted to bring it to California \"to show that this is a nonpartisan issue\". \"This is a human issue,\" she said.SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A critically endangered Puerto Rican toad was for the first time born via in vitro fertilization as U.S. scientists attempt to save it from extinction, officials announced Friday. Olaf - named in honor of the frozen semen he came from — is the first of more than 300 Puerto Rican crested toads that hatched after the first attempt failed, Diane Barber, ectotherms curator at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, told The Associated Press. \"We don\\'t typically name our toads, but that one deserved special recognition,\" she said via phone. \"We were super, super excited. You kind of hold your breath for 30 days to see if they\\'re going to metamorphose\". Barber was part of a team that traveled to the southwest town of Guayanilla last year to collect semen from six male Puerto Rican crested toads that were later released back into the wild. The scientists were careful to select bigger toads that had what are called \"nuptial pads\" on their thumbs, which indicate sexual maturity and help them grab on to females, she said. Extracting semen from toads that measure up to 4.5 inches (11 centimeters) long is normally easy: they release it in their urine, and they usually pee whenever they\\'re picked up, Barber said. But for those toads that did not pee, another tactic was used. \"It\\'s kind of weird, but if you hold them in your hand and look at them and bark at them like a dog, they will pee,\" she said. The team, which included scientists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Puerto Rico\\'s Department of Natural Resources, among others, preserved the semen in liquid nitrogen as they transported it to the Fort Worth Zoo, where a couple of female toads injected with hormones awaited. Efforts to save the Puerto Rican crested toad date back a couple of decades, but this is the first time in vitro fertilization was used, according to Armando Otero, interim secretary of the island\\'s Department of Natural Resources. \"This is a significant advance for critically endangered species, as it will allow zoos, researchers and other conservationists to expand their genetic population used to increase the general population while keeping toads in their natural and wild habitat,\" he said in a statement. To prepare the toads for successful reproduction, scientists expose them to cooler temperatures for about three months and sometimes will even re-create rain, Barber said. Of the more than 300 toads that were born via in vitro, 100 were sent to other zoos with captive breeding programs and the remaining 200 will be sent to Puerto Rico in December via FedEx to be released into the wild. The Puerto Rican crested toad was thought extinct until the 1960s and was then rediscovered in the early 1980s. Most of the population lives in the southern half of the U.S. territory, with no northern toads spotted since 1992. But concerns are growing about their ability to survive climate change. In the southwest coastal town of Guánica, where the population remains most stable, rising sea levels are threatening their habitat, Barber said. The toads live near the beach, and scientists fear that in upcoming years, saltwater will seep into the ponds they use for breeding. The toad\\'s wild population in Puerto Rico is estimated anywhere from 300 to 3,000, Barber said, adding that they\\'re very cryptic. While Puerto Rico is known for its coquí frogs and their beautiful calls, Barber said that the crested toads sound \"more like a car engine that\\'s trying to start\". \"For what they lack in their call, they have these beautiful golden eyes and ducklike beak noses that turn up,\" she said.BEIJING (AP) — Stocks logged modest gains Friday in Asia after a lackluster overnight session on Wall Street ended with the market\\'s third straight drop. Reports suggesting Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Beijing\\'s lead trade negotiator, has invited U.S. officials to China for talks helped alleviate worries over progress in resolving the tariff war between the two largest economies. On Thursday, China\\'s Commerce Ministry sought to bat away rumors that the trade talks were in trouble, with a spokesman saying Beijing was committed to continuing discussions on core concerns. Japan\\'s Nikkei 225 index gained 0.4% to 23,130.31 while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong picked up 0.2% to 26,524.88. South Korea\\'s Kospi edged 0.2% higher to 2,100.38 and the S&P ASX 200 in Australia advanced 0.5% to 6,707.90. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.6% to 2,886.47, while shares rose in Bangkok and Singapore but fell in Taiwan and Jakarta. Overnight, stocks closed modestly lower on Wall Street in the third straight day of declines after a mostly listless day of trading. Losses in technology stocks, companies that rely on consumer spending and other sectors outweighed gains elsewhere in the market. Energy sector stocks were the biggest winners, benefiting from another pickup in crude oil prices. Health care and communication services companies also rose. Investors have turned cautious this week amid concerns that the U.S. and China will fail to make a trade deal before the year is over. The world\\'s largest economies have been negotiating a resolution to their trade war ahead of new tariffs set to hit key consumer goods on Dec. 15. Investors have been hoping for a deal before that happens, as the tariffs would increase prices on smartphones, laptops and many common household goods. \"That Dec. 15 deadline on tariffs still weighs on the market,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"The market needs a sense that there won\\'t be an escalation in the trade war\". The benchmark S&P 500 index dropped 0.2% to 3,103.54 and is on track to snap a six-week winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% to 27,766.29. The Nasdaq slid 0.2% to 8,506.21 while the Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks lost 0.5%, to 1,583.96. Stocks are likely to remain choppy and risky as long as the trade war and threat of new tariffs looms over Wall Street, said Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel. \"We don\\'t want to see tariffs on consumer goods that get passed on directly to retail purchasers because they\\'re the last leg on which the economy is standing right now,\" Bannister said. Bannister warned that the market could be in for a significant decline before the end of the year if the U.S. and China can\\'t make progress. He also said the risk of a larger recession has not disappeared. Technology stocks took some of the heaviest losses Thursday. Many chipmakers and companies that make hardware rely on China for sales and supply chains. Advanced Micro Devices slid 3.6% and Lam Research fell 3.7%. Consumer product makers also fell broadly. Kraft Heinz dropped 2.7%. In energy trading Friday, benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 39 cents to $58.19 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose $1.57 to settle at $58.58 a barrel on Thursday. Brent crude oil, the international standard, declined 37 cents to $63.60 per barrel. The dollar was flat at 108.63 Japanese yen. The euro rose to $1.1065 from $1.1061 on Thursday. AP Business Writers Damian J. Troise and Alex Veiga contributed.NEW YORK (AP) — The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):.

The shutdown across a nation of 80 million people was the first to effectively isolate a modern, highly developed domestic network, experts say. That makes it a milestone in efforts by authoritarian governments to censor online communications. Other governments — such as Ethiopia\\'s — have imposed longer internet shutdowns. And Russia is exerting more central control over its internet. But nothing to date equals Iran\\'s shutdown in logistical complexity, the experts say. \"There is a desperate move to control all information in the country and to ensure that the government has a monopoly on information,\" said Adrian Shahbaz, research director for technology and democracy at Freedom House, a watchdog group. Despite the open nature of the internet, a combination of technical measures and political pressure in repressive states can isolate large populations from free-flowing information. Some governments, especially during unrest, have been accused of trying to prevent the spread of videos and images showing police violence against protesters. They do so by throttling, or slowing down, internet connectivity or blocking access to specific applications such as Google search. It\\'s happened on multiple occasions in Venezuela. Iran acted to staunch demonstrations in a reported 100 cities and towns. After gas prices were increased, demonstrators abandoned cars along major highways and joined mass protests in the capital, Tehran, and elsewhere. Some protests turned violent. The Iranian government can throttle or block access because there are just two principal gateways, known as exchanges, that connect the country to the global internet, and the government controls both. By Thursday, some fixed-line access to homes was coming back, said Mahsa Alimardani, a doctoral student at the Oxford Internet Institute and activist with the human rights group Article 19. Unlike China, which has long exerted central control of the internet, Iranians built a decentralized internet. But authorities have gradually reined it in following protests over a disputed presidential election in 2009. Iran\\'s connectivity with the global internet stood at 15 percent, according to NetBlocks, an independent group that monitors worldwide internet access. Separately, the group said in a blog post that Iraq had restored access to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for most users there after blocking it for 50 days. NetBlocks calculates the economic impact of this week\\'s outage at $300 million, based on the Iranian information technology sector\\'s share of domestic productivity. What remained active — after some early glitches — was the National Information Network, in which authorities have invested heavily in recent years. It amounts to a closed, domestic internet that can be nearly isolated from the rest of the world. That system allows banks, government agencies and universities to continue to function. Some of those institutions — such as the central bank — retained access to the global internet even as mobile networks and homes had no connectivity. Economic damage would have been far worse if Iran were not already hobbled by international sanctions over its nuclear program. Nevertheless, many Iranians have come to depend on outside services such as Telegram, an encrypted communications app, to do business internationally. The government\\'s efforts to develop domestic alternatives to Western internet services have not been very successful, Alimardani said. Alternatives include a homegrown version of the Google-owned traffic app Waze and a messaging and social networking app called Soroush. Iranians tend to shun such apps, assuming them to be monitored by police and intelligence agents. That\\'s in contrast to China, where home-grown apps such as WeChat have thrived. The Iranian government moved to censor Telegram in 2018, but people have found ways to circumvent the censorship, as they have in Russia. Virtual private network programs, in which users connect to the internet through encrypted tunnels with gateways abroad, are used to try to foil government censors, with mixed results. Experts say there will likely be more efforts by governments to exert control over the internet, effectively destroying its open global architecture. Russia is already moving toward what the Kremlin calls \"internet sovereignty\". Under a new law, Russia is pushing filtering equipment on internet service providers that will serve a double purpose — blacklisting outside websites and services the government doesn\\'t want people to see and surveilling their activity. University of Michigan researchers say the model can be easily exported, challenging the notion that decentralized internet service can prevent large-scale censorship. On Monday, the U.N. General Assembly\\'s human rights committee approved a resolution drafted by Russia that independent rights groups call an effort by the Kremlin to expand its model of state control. Approval by the 193-member assembly in December is thus virtually certain.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has a sophisticated machine at his disposal for gathering and analyzing information: the U.S. government. But many of his inflammatory statements come from another place, an ethereal world where his sources are never identified:. \"They say. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". Over the past week of impeachment hearings, Trump blew past the consensus of national security and foreign policy professionals, dismissing them as Never Trumpers, and dug in with his theory of Ukrainian misdeeds that they said is false. In the course of that, he continued to describe an American company as a Ukrainian one and its American chief as a Ukrainian rich man. Here\\'s a look at some of the rhetoric from and about the House Intelligence Committee hearings as well as some remarks by Democratic presidential contenders who tried in their latest debate to be heard above the impeachment din:. TRUMP, referring to Democrats: \"The FBI went in and they told them, get out of here, you\\'re not getting — we\\'re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it\\'s called, which is a country — which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That\\'s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company? Why?\" — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s statement is false in multiple ways. CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company — it is based in Sunnyvale, California. It is not owned by a Ukrainian, but rather an American who emigrated to the U.S. as a child — from Russia, not Ukraine. The cybersecurity firm made the original determination that Russia was responsible for the 2016 hack of Democratic emails that were subsequently disclosed by WikiLeaks. The company counts among its clients the National Republican Congressional Committee, for which it investigated email thefts by unidentified hackers during the 2018 campaign. When Trump says the \"FBI has never gotten that server,\" he is referring to the fact that the FBI did not receive physical servers from the Democratic National Committee after its emails were hacked in the 2016 campaign. Instead, the FBI relied on detailed forensics provided by CrowdStrike. The FBI confirmed those findings. Using that evidence, special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s team charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with the hack. Still, Trump persists not only in misidentifying the nationality of the owner and what country the firm is from, but in advancing the notion that Ukrainians hacked the DNC and made it look as if Russians did it. TRUMP: \"A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right, from the DNC, Democratic National Committee, you know. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump is shrugging off not only the week\\'s testimony of current and former aides at the hearing, but advice going back months from officials who told him such assertions are invalid. None of the witnesses who testified at the hearings — including those the Republicans wanted to hear from — gave credence to Trump\\'s theory that Ukraine attacked the U.S. election and tried to make Russia look like the villain. Several testified to the contrary, that there is no evidence of Ukraine interference. Even before his July phone call pressing Ukraine\\'s president to investigate the theory, his own staff repeatedly told him it was \"completely debunked,\" Trump\\'s first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said in September. \"Fictions,\" a former senior director on the National Security Council for Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, testified Thursday. She told committee members: \"I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests\". TRUMP: \"I don\\'t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy, though. But I don\\'t know him well\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: That\\'s not credible. Testimony by several officials revealed that Sondland, Trump\\'s EU ambassador, was in frequent contact with Trump around the time Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about doing a politically beneficial \"favor\". Tim Morrison, the former NSC Russia and Europe senior director, who took over from Hill in July, told House investigators that Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released as Trump pressed for the favor. Morrison said the ambassador \"related to me he was acting — he was discussing these matters with the president\". Sondland himself changed his testimony Wednesday to acknowledge more contacts with Trump than previously revealed. As recently as Oct. 8, Trump had tweeted that Sondland was a \"really good man and great American\". Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\\'s inaugural committee before being named the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. But Trump quickly became less familiar with his ambassador when Sondland testified that the president wanted a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats as a condition for his releasing U.S. military aid to that country. PAM BONDI, White House adviser: \"We\\'re going to hear what Gordon Sondland has to say today. He was the ambassador to the Ukraine\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: Sondland is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, not Ukraine. TRUMP: \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn\\'t care about American Workers!\" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Neither happened. Trump visited a factory in Austin, Texas, that has made the Mac Pro for Apple since 2013. Apple announced in September that it would continue having the Mac Pro line made in Austin, after the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on certain computer parts from China. It also plans to expand its already deeply rooted business in Austin and said Wednesday it has started construction of its new campus in the city. None of that equates to Trump\\'s false claim to have opened an Apple plant Wednesday. Meantime, the House worked into Wednesday evening, after Trump\\'s false tweet that Pelosi had shut Congress, and again Thursday before breaking for Thanksgiving week. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, Democratic committee chairman: \"I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression, listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing, that Russia didn\\'t intervene in our election. It was all the Ukrainians\". — hearing Thursday. HILL: \"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves\". — hearing Thursday. REP. ELISE STEFANIK, Republican of New York: \"Not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections. To have our Democratic colleagues say these untruthful statements just reeks of political desperation\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Stefanik may be right that Republicans on the committee did not explicitly deny that Russia attacked the U.S. election. Yet Schiff and Hill may also be right in saying that Republicans left that impression at the hearings. Some Republicans on the committee repeatedly gave credence to the conspiracy theory that holds that Ukrainians actually hacked the Democratic National Committee emails, perhaps with a server that was in their country, and made it look as if Russia did it. To buy into this theory is to discount Russian culpability. A 2018 report by the then-Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election, but disagreed with parts of the agencies\\' assessment that said Russia did so to help Trump. REP. DEVIN NUNES of California: Trump has good reason to be wary \"of widespread corruption in that country\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: The committee\\'s top Republican is pointing to an oft-made defense by Trump and GOP allies that he withheld military aid to Ukraine because of concerns about corruption. But the hearings produced bountiful testimony that Trump was singularly focused on making Democrats the target of Ukrainian investigations. In his first phone call with Ukraine\\'s new leader, in April, the White House said at the time that Trump discussed his interest in having Ukraine rein in widespread corruption. But in the recently released rough transcript of the call, he did not mention corruption at all. Trump had $391 million in congressionally approved U.S. assistance withheld from Ukraine from July to September. The Defense Department had already certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the military assistance. Before the July hold on the aid, the Trump administration had approved sending aid to Ukraine nearly 50 times without holding it because of corruption concerns. Witnesses testified that Trump did not articulate concerns about Ukraine corruption other than expressing interest into investigations that would benefit him politically. In his July 25 call, Trump told Zelenskiy as they discussed military aid, \"I would like for you to do us a favor, though\" and investigate Joe Biden, his son and Democrats going back to the 2016 U.S. election, citing in part the discredited conspiracy theory involving Ukraine in that election. Trump ultimately released the aid, on Sept. 11, after Congress became aware of what he had done. A few days earlier, congressional committees had begun looking into the matter, aware that a whistleblower had a complaint in motion. NUNES: \"Now that the whistleblower has successfully kickstarted impeachment, he has disappeared from the story, as if the Democrats put the whistleblower in their own witness protection program\". — hearing Tuesday. THE FACTS: The whistleblower hasn\\'t \"disappeared\". That person has offered to submit written testimony; Republicans have rejected that. Trump and his GOP allies are suggesting that the whistleblower\\'s complaint is false, and so the person has vanished. But key details were corroborated by people with firsthand knowledge of the events who appeared on Capitol Hill. TRUMP: \"Right now you have a kangaroo court headed by little shifty Schiff, where we don\\'t have lawyers, we don\\'t have witnesses, we don\\'t have anything\". — Cabinet meeting. THE FACTS: Depends on the meaning of \"we\". Republicans on the committee had a lawyer asking questions of the witnesses, so it\\'s not true that they had no legal representation. And several witnesses were invited at the request of Republicans on the committee. It\\'s also true, though, that Trump himself did not have a lawyer speaking for him at the hearings. That\\'s not unusual. The inquiry is meant to be a fact-finding process and the president is not charged with anything. He will have legal representation if the House Judiciary Committee moves ahead to draft articles of impeachment against him. BERNIE SANDERS: \"What the scientists are telling us is if we don\\'t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we\\'re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we\\'re talking about increased drought, we\\'re talking about increased extreme weather disturbances\". — Democratic debate Wednesday. THE FACTS: To be clear, the world\\'s big cities aren\\'t going to go underwater for good in as soon as eight to nine years. The Vermont senator\\'s reference to eight to nine years seems to refer to standard warnings of the expected temperature increases kicking in by roughly 2030, and the progressively worse weather extremes that will keep following. JOE BIDEN: \"The fact is the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That statement is at odds with a Kaiser Family Foundation poll out this week. It found that 77% of Democrats support Medicare for All. Even more — 88% — support a \"public option\" proposal such as the one Biden advocates. It would allow people to buy into a new government insurance plan modeled on Medicare, but it would not completely replace private insurance. Overall, 53% of Americans support Medicare for All, while 43% oppose it, according to the Kaiser poll. It\\'s also true, though, that public support for Medicare for All declines when costs and other, similar details are introduced in the polling. ELIZABETH WARREN: \"Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, (of) whites who borrowed money, 94% have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African Americans have paid it off\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That\\'s not right. Warren appears to be citing a September report from Brandeis University\\'s Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The study found that, 20 years after starting college, 49% of white borrowers had paid off their loans entirely (not 94% of them) compared with 26% of black borrowers (not 5%). The study also found that the typical white student had paid off 94% of his or her debt, while the typical black borrower had only paid off 5%. Warren cited those statistics, but in the wrong way. She\\'s correct that there are disparities by race when it comes to paying back student loans. Other studies have similarly found that black borrowers are at greater risk of default than their white counterparts. TULSI GABBARD: \"The most recent example of inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels\". — Democratic debate. PETE BUTTIGIEG: \"That is outlandish, even by the standards of today\\'s politics. I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We\\'ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\" — Democratic debate. GABBARD: \"You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes. The fact checkers can check this out\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: Neither offered a fully accurate account in their exchange. Gabbard did not accuse Buttigieg of being open to \"invading\" Mexico, as he suggested she did. But she did not explain the context of his remarks at a Latino-issues forum in Los Angeles last Sunday. At the forum, he heavily conditioned the idea of sending troops to help Mexico fight the drug and gang war, saying he would only do so if Mexico wanted the assistance as part of a security partnership. \"There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,\" he said in Los Angeles. \"I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this were necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations. \"But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role if and only if it is welcome by our partner south of the border\". Associated Press writers Eric Tucker, Mary Clare Jalonick, Lisa Mascaro, Lynn Berry, Mark Sherman, Kevin Freking, Ellen Knickmeyer and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington, Collin Binkley in Boston, Kathleen Ronayne in Los Angeles and Amanda Seitz in Chicago contributed to this report.

Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck.TOKYO (AP) — Global shares rose Monday amid some optimism that the U.S. and China may be edging closer toward a deal on a trade dispute that has been rattling markets for more than a year. Over the weekend, Beijing issued new guidelines for protecting intellectual property, a key concern for foreign investors and a sore point in the dispute with Washington over trade and technology. Britain\\'s FTSE 100 rose 0.9% to 7,394, while France\\'s CAC 40 added 0.4% in midday trading to 5,915. Germany\\'s DAX gained 0.4% to 13,221 after a survey showed that German business confidence has increased slightly. U.S. shares were set to drift higher with Dow futures adding 0.3% to 27,931 and S&P 500 futures rising 0.2% to 3,119. Japan\\'s benchmark Nikkei 225 surged 0.8% to finish at 23,292.81, while Australia\\'s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3% to 6,731.40. South Korea\\'s Kospi gained 1.0% to 2,123.50. Hong Kong\\'s Hang Seng jumped 1.5% to 26,993.04, while the Shanghai Composite advanced 0.7% to 2,906.17. Investors were watching the situation in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy candidates won a majority of seats in a local district council election Sunday. After nearly six months of often violent protests, it is yet another challenge for Chief Executive Carrie Lam\\'s government. \"The result might not be market-friendly as it sets to challenge Carrie Lam\\'s leadership and bring up political uncertainties. But it could also mark a turning point in stopping the violent clashes,\" said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore. Markets around the world churned last week on uncertainty about whether the U.S. and China can soon halt their trade dispute, or at least stop it from escalating. Tariffs already put in place have hurt manufacturing around the world, and businesses have held back on spending given all the uncertainty about where the rules of global trade will end up. New U.S. tariffs are set to hit Dec. 15 on many Chinese-made items on holiday shopping lists, such as smartphones and laptops. A document issued Sunday called for China to \"effectively curb\" violations of intellectual property rights such as trademarks and copyrights. The guidelines ordered improvements to laws for protecting such intellectual property, increased compensation for infringements and stricter enforcement of existing laws. Theft and forced transfers of technology and inadequate protection of copyrights, patents and trademarks are perennial complaints of foreign companies operating in China and are among the key issues in the latest flareup in trade tensions. President Donald Trump said last week that a deal is \"potentially very close\" after Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing is working to \"try not to have a trade war,\" but will nevertheless fight back if necessary. In corporate news, shares in Uber fell about 6% in premarket after London\\'s transit authority refused to renew the San Francisco company\\'s license to operate there over passenger safety concerns. Uber vowed to appeal the decision, which it called \"extraordinary and wrong\". The ride-hailing company has 21 days to file an appeal and can continue operating while the appeals process is under way. Two blockbuster mergers got Thanksgiving week off to a rousing start Monday morning. Shares of Tiffany & Co. rose nearly 6% in premarket trading after Paris-based LVMH said it was acquiring the iconic New York jeweler for $16.2 billion. In another massive deal, Charles Schwab said it would buy rival TD Ameritrade in a $26 billion stock swap. With brokerages facing competitive pressure to make it free for customers to trade U.S. stocks online, Schwab\\'s buyout combines two of the biggest players in the industry, with a combined $5 trillion in client assets. The deal could draw sharp scrutiny from antitrust regulators. ENERGY: Benchmark crude lost 9 cents to $57.68 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 81 cents to $57.77 a barrel on Friday. Brent crude oil, the international standard, dropped $1.06 to $62.33 a barrel. CURRENCIES: The dollar strengthened to 108.88 Japanese yen from 108.64 yen on Friday. The euro slipped to $1.1017 from $1.1022.A group of Democratic U.S. senators is questioning Amazon about the security of its Ring doorbell cameras following reports that some Ukraine-based employees had access to video footage from customers\\' homes. A letter to Amazon Wednesday from Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and four other Democrats said the internet-connected devices may pose national security concerns. News site The Intercept reported in January that Ring employees in the U.S. and Ukraine had access to personal data from cameras around the world. The report said Ring gave a variety of employees and executives access to recorded and sometimes live video footage from customers\\' homes. Besides citing the report, the senators noted that Ring devices routinely store video recordings and other data on Amazon servers. \"If hackers or foreign actors were to gain access to this data, it would not only threaten the privacy and safety of the impacted Americans; it could also threaten U.S. national security,\" the senators wrote. \"Personal data can be exploited by foreign intelligence services to amplify the impact of espionage and influence operations\". The senators asked the company to explain its practices to address security vulnerabilities. Ring says it\\'s reviewing the letter. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Christopher Coons of Delaware and Gary Peters of Michigan joined the letter. The letter comes after Markey on Tuesday released Amazon\\'s responses to separate privacy and civil liberty concerns. In the response, Amazon said it has considered adding facial recognition technology to its Ring cameras, calling it a \"contemplated, but unreleased feature\". Amazon said there are no plans to coordinate such a feature with existing partnerships with law enforcement. Amazon has been encouraging police to tap into Ring\\'s Neighbors app, a forum for residents to share videos of suspicious activity captured by their home security cameras. Markey expressed alarm that Ring may be pursuing face-scanning technology after a patent application showed the company is exploring a system that could flag certain people as suspicious and automatically alert police. More than 600 police departments have signed up to Ring\\'s network since last year and many say it is becoming a useful crime-fighting tool.S&P 500 snaps 6-week string of gains even as stocks rise. NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks shook off a midday stumble to finish slightly higher Friday, though the modest rebound was not enough to keep the S&P 500 from breaking its longest stretch of weekly gains in two years. Banks, health care stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending powered much of the rebound, outweighing losses in technology, real estate and other sectors. Oil prices fell. Uncertainty about whether the U.S. and China can soon halt their trade dispute weighed on markets this week. Stainless steel, broken glass and buzz, Tesla makes a pickup. The much-hyped unveil of Tesla\\'s electric pickup truck went off script Thursday night when supposedly unbreakable window glass shattered twice when hit with a large metal ball. The failed stunt, which ranks high on the list of embarrassing auto industry rollouts, came just after CEO Elon Musk bragged about the strength of \"Tesla Armor Glass\" on the wedge-shaped \"Cybertruck\". Boeing settles half of lawsuits tied to Indonesian crash. CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing says it has settled more than 60 lawsuits filed by families of passengers who died in the first crash of a 737 Max jet. That\\'s about half of the lawsuits filed after the October 2018 crash involving a Max off the coast of Indonesia that killed 157. Boeing faces dozens more lawsuits over a second Max crash, which happened in March in Ethiopia. US regulators bar govt telecom funds for Huawei, ZTE. WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. communications regulators have cut off government funding for equipment from two Chinese companies, citing security threats. They are also proposing to require companies to also rip out existing equipment Huawei and ZTE. The move mostly affects small, rural companies, as larger carriers do not use such equipment. Huawei says the rule is unlawful, as there is no evidence it poses a security risk. It\\'s the latest move by the U.S. government against Chinese tech and telecom companies. European Central Bank chief asks governments to help growth. FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The new president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, says better-targeted public spending would help support economic growth in the eurozone. In her first official speech Friday, Lagarde indirectly chided countries like Germany that have kept a tight grip on their budgets while making clear that a spendthrift approach to public spending would be hazardous, too. In a first, IBM\\'s computer debater faces off against itself. CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) — IBM\\'s artificial intelligence debating robot faced off against itself at Cambridge University, in a demonstration of what the future might hold. Project Debater, a robot that has already debated humans, was for the first time pitted against itself, at least in the first round of arguments at the Cambridge Union, the world\\'s oldest debating society. The topic was whether artificial intelligence would do more harm than good. US officials: Don\\'t eat romaine grown in Salinas, California. NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials investigating a food poisoning outbreak are warning people not to eat romaine lettuce grown in Salinas, California. They say not to eat romaine if the label doesn\\'t say where it\\'s grown. The Food and Drug Administration says its investigation of people sickened with E. coli has led them to farms in Salinas and that they\\'re looking for the source of the contamination. The warning follows repeated outbreaks tied to romaine. Amazon pulls skin-lightening products off site amid pushback. ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Amazon has pulled more than a dozen skin-lightening products with dangerous mercury levels off its website after pushback from Minnesota public-health and environmental activists. The company\\'s change came after the BeautyWell Project and the Sierra Club\\'s state branch delivered a petition on Wednesday with over 23,000 signatures to Amazon\\'s fulfillment center in Shakopee. California boosts pot taxes, shocking unsteady industry. LOS ANGELES (AP) — California is increasing pot business taxes in the legal market, shocking the state\\'s struggling marijuana companies. Hefty marijuana taxes that can approach 50 percent in some communities have been blamed for sending shoppers into the tax-free illegal market, which is thriving. The California Cannabis Industry Association says its members are \"stunned and outraged\". The group says the tax increases will be passed on to consumers, pushing more to shoppers underground. Isolated Iceland newly vulnerable to computer scams. REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) — The people of Iceland, who speak a dialect of Old Norse, are no longer protected from online fraud because of their linguistic isolation. Modern translation apps have become good at Icelandic. The government, meanwhile, has lifted limits on bank transfers out of the country that were imposed after the financial crisis. The combination has attracted scammers to target a population that had so far not had to worry about online fraud. The S&P 500 rose 6.75 points, or 0.2%, to 3,110.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 109.33 points, or 0.4%, to 27,875.62. The Nasdaq composite added 13.67 points, or 0.2%, to 8,519.88. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 4.98 points, or 0.3%, to 1,588.94.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wall Street is enjoying its third record-setting run of this year, with the major stock indexes delivering a string of all-time highs in recent weeks. The S&P 500 has set new highs 23 times this year through Monday, up from 19 last year. The benchmark index, which closed above 3,100 points for the first time last week, also broke records in April and July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed above the 28,000 mark for the first time last week, has set 12 new records so far this year, trailing the 15 it set last year. Meanwhile the technology heavy Nasdaq composite has marked 23 new highs as of Tuesday, beating last year\\'s 16 times. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are now up by more than 20% this year, while the Dow is up nearly 19%. The indexes\\' latest record-setting run has extended the life of the longest-ever bull market for stocks, which marked 10 years in March after nearly falling 20% in December. \"If you look back over history, new highs tend to clump together in secular bull markets,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. A secular bull market typically runs several years, weathering cycles of heavy selling. \"That\\'s what we\\'ve been in the past few years and there\\'s not evidence at this point that\\'s ended,\" he added. The market began grinding out new highs in late October after emerging from a late-summer slump caused by fears that the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession. Those concerns have eased as investors have been encouraged by surprisingly good third quarter corporate earnings, a third interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and other data showing the economy hasn\\'t slowed as much as economists feared. Hopes that the U.S. and China can make progress on a trade deal have also helped keep investors in a buying mood. Still, the gains have been concentrated among the market\\'s biggest companies. Apple, Microsoft, Google\\'s parent Alphabet, Walt Disney, AT&T and JPMorgan Chase all hit all-time highs this month. And all have outgained the overall S&P 500 so far this year, except for Alphabet, which has matched the index\\'s gain of about 24%. \"You\\'d like to see a lot of individual stocks making new highs along with the indexes and that\\'s not happening right now,\" Delwiche said. \"A handful of stocks are driving the indexes higher\". Technology stocks have led the way as the market racked up milestones this month. As of Tuesday, the sector was up more than 41% so far this year, well ahead of the other 10 sectors in the S&P 500. Communication services, industrials and financials are also holding on to solid gains. Energy is trailing well behind the rest of the pack.DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 25, 2019--.

The transaction is part of a review that eBay undertook earlier this year following pressure from an activist investor. The San Jose, California-based company then said it was also reviewing options for its classified ads business. EBay Inc. bought StubHub in 2007 for $310 million. Both StubHub and the classifieds business each brought in less than 10% of eBay\\'s total revenue last year. The addition of StubHub will allow viagogo to sell tickets in more than 70 countries and give buyers access to a wider selection of tickets. Viagogo\\'s founder and CEO Eric Baker is a StubHub co-founder. In a statement, Baker said it has been his longtime wish to unite the two companies. The sale is targeted to close by the end of 2020\\'s first quarter. This story has been corrected to show the transaction is worth $4.05 billion, not $4.5 billion.WASHINGTON (AP) — Amazon is suing the Pentagon over a $10 billion cloud-computing contract awarded to Microsoft. Amazon said it filed a legal complaint Friday with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking to challenge the decision. The complaint is sealed, but the company said earlier this month there was \"unmistakable bias\" on the government\\'s part. Amazon\\'s competitive bid for the \"war cloud\" project drew criticism from President Donald Trump, who said over the summer that he wanted the Pentagon to take a closer look. The Pentagon awarded the contract to Microsoft in late October. U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said the procurement was done fairly without outside influence. The contract, formally called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, was sought by Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and IBM.NEW YORK (AP) — The latest on developments in financial markets (all times local):. Stocks are closing slightly lower on Wall Street, giving the market its third straight drop. Technology stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending led the way lower Thursday. Those losses offset gains in the energy, communication services and health care sectors. Investors have turned cautious this week amid concerns that the U.S. and China will fail to make a trade deal before the year is over.

Texas said Monday that it has made its own settlement with T-Mobile. The state attorneys general go to trial Dec. 9, arguing that the T-Mobile-Sprint deal will raise prices and be bad for competition. Mississippi and Colorado left the coalition in October, but 14 states and the District of Columbia remain. Texas says T-Mobile won\\'t raise wireless prices in the state for five years and that it will build a next-generation 5G network in Texas. T-Mobile has already promised a national 5G network and to keep prices steady for three years to federal regulators. They have approved the deal.NEW YORK (AP) — Apple has canceled the premiere of one of the tech company\\'s first original films, \"The Banker\" the day before it was to debut at Los Angeles\\' AFI Film Festival. In a statement Wednesday, Apple said that last week it learned of \"some concerns\" surrounding \"The Banker\" and needs \"some time to look into these matters\". An Apple spokesperson declined to elaborate. The based-on-a-true-story film stars Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie. Mackie plays Bernard Garrett who in the 1950s and \\'60s recruited a white man to pose as the face of his expansive real estate and banking business. In 1968, Garrett was convicted of misusing bank funds. The film is Apple\\'s boldest step yet into moviemaking. A theatrical release is scheduled for Dec. 6, after which it would be a part of the company\\'s new streaming service, Apple TV Plus. AFI said it would replace \"The Banker\" with a screening of Noah Baumbach\\'s Netflix release \"Marriage Story\" as its closing-night film.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump\\'s latest reasons for firing Marie Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine: She was an \"Obama person\" who refused to hang Trump\\'s portrait in the U.S. Embassy. That\\'s false on both counts. Trump\\'s pique about not having his picture displayed in a timely way — actually the fault of his administration, not the ambassador — came during a week of unfounded or distorted statements by the president about the impeachment inquiry and the political favor he sought from Ukraine. A look at recent claims, as well as from Democratic presidential contenders in their latest debate:. TRUMP: \"This ambassador that everybody says is so wonderful, she wouldn\\'t hang my picture in the embassy. She\\'s in charge of the embassy. She wouldn\\'t hang it. It took like a year and a half or two years for her to get the picture up\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: She\\'s not the reason why Trump\\'s photo wasn\\'t displayed in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine after his inauguration. Trump\\'s official portrait for display in federal facilities was not released by the White House until October 2017. Portraits for U.S. embassies came months after that. Lewis Lukens, former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in London, tweeted Friday: \"I was in charge of the US embassy in London for much of Trump\\'s first year. We didn\\'t hang his picture either. It took the WH almost 15 months to get official photos sent to embassies to hang. And we were instructed not to print other photos\". The former ambassador to Georgia, Ian Kelly, tweeted: \"Our official White House portraits did not arrive at Embassy Tbilisi until March 2018. This was because the WH was late getting them to all embassies\". Yovanovitch\\'s attorney, Larry Robbins, told The Associated Press that the embassy in Kyiv hung Trump\\'s official portrait, along with Vice President Mike Pence\\'s and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\'s, \"as soon as they arrived from Washington, DC\". Trump previously accused Yovanovitch of leaving countries in disarray \"everywhere\" she went as a diplomat, wholly misrepresenting her record. In any event, a president doesn\\'t need to give a reason for firing an ambassador. TRUMP: \"This was an Obama person\". — Fox interview. THE FACTS: No, she is a nonpartisan civil servant who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations as a 33-year State Department employee. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and then Armenia by Republican President George W. Bush. Then she was named to the Ukraine ambassadorship by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2016. Trump dismissed her from that post in May. TRUMP: \"Why isn\\'t Germany, France, the European Union, why aren\\'t all those countries in Europe, why aren\\'t they paying? Why is it always the United States the sucker? I got elected on that\". — Fox interview Friday. THE FACTS: He\\'s incorrect that the U.S. is \"always\" the one putting up Ukraine aid. European Union institutions have provided far more development assistance than the $204 million from Washington. Specific EU members, Japan and Canada also contribute significantly. Since 2014, the EU and European financial institutions have mobilized more than $16 billion to help Ukraine\\'s economy, counter corruption, build institutions and strengthen its sovereignty against further incursions by Russia after its annexation of Crimea. The U.S. is a heavy source of military assistance. The aid package held back by Trump as he pressed Ukraine to investigate Democrats was worth nearly $400 million. But NATO also contributes a variety of military-assistance programs and trust funds for Ukraine. In most such cases, the programs are modest and NATO countries other than the U.S. take the lead. TRUMP: \"Why should we give money to a country that\\'s known corrupt?\" — Fox News interview Friday. REP. DEVIN NUNES of California, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee: Trump has good reason to be wary \"of widespread corruption in that country\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s defense that he withheld aid to Ukraine due to corruption concerns is shaky. Two weeks of hearings produced bountiful testimony that Trump was singularly focused on getting Ukraine to open investigations into Democrats. In his first phone call with Ukraine\\'s new leader, in April, the White House said at the time that Trump discussed his interest in having Ukraine rein in widespread corruption. But in the recently released rough transcript of the call, he actually did not mention corruption at all. Trump had $391 million in congressionally approved U.S. assistance withheld from Ukraine from July to September. The Defense Department had already certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made enough progress on reducing corruption to receive the military assistance. Before the July hold on the aid, the Trump administration had approved sending aid to Ukraine nearly 50 times without holding it because of corruption concerns. Witnesses testified that Trump did not articulate concerns about Ukraine corruption other than expressing interest into investigations that would benefit him politically. In his July 25 call, Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as they discussed military aid, \"I would like for you to do us a favor, though\" and investigate Joe Biden, his son and Democrats going back to the 2016 U.S. election, based on a discredited theory involving purported Ukrainian interference in the election. Trump ultimately released the aid, on Sept. 11, after Congress became aware of what he had done. A few days earlier, congressional committees had begun looking into the matter, aware that a whistleblower had a complaint in motion. TRUMP, referring to Democrats: \"The FBI went in and they told them, get out of here, you\\'re not getting — we\\'re not giving it to you. They gave the server to CrowdStrike, or whatever it\\'s called, which is a country — which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian. And I still want to see that server. You know, the FBI has never gotten that server. That\\'s a big part of this whole thing. Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company? Why?\" — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump\\'s statement is false in multiple ways. CrowdStrike is not a Ukrainian company — it is based in Sunnyvale, California. It is not owned by a Ukrainian, but rather an American who emigrated to the U.S. as a child — from Russia, not Ukraine. The cybersecurity firm made the original determination that Russia was responsible for the 2016 hack of Democratic emails that were subsequently disclosed by WikiLeaks. The company counts among its clients the National Republican Congressional Committee, for which it investigated email thefts by unidentified hackers during the 2018 campaign. When Trump says the \"FBI has never gotten that server,\" he is referring to the fact that the FBI did not receive physical servers from the Democratic National Committee after its emails were hacked in the 2016 campaign. Instead, the FBI relied on detailed forensics provided by CrowdStrike. The FBI confirmed those findings. Using that evidence, special counsel Robert Mueller\\'s team charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with the hack. Still, Trump persists not only in misidentifying the nationality of the owner and what country the firm is from, but in advancing the notion that Ukrainians hacked the DNC and made it look as if Russians did it. TRUMP: \"A lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine. They have the server, right, from the DNC, Democratic National Committee, you know. Well, that\\'s what the word is. That\\'s the way it was explained\". — Fox News interview Friday. THE FACTS: Trump is shrugging off not only the week\\'s testimony of current and former aides at the hearing, but advice going back months from officials who told him such assertions are invalid. None of the witnesses who testified at the hearings — including those the Republicans wanted to hear from — gave credence to Trump\\'s theory that Ukraine attacked the U.S. election and tried to make Russia look like the villain. Several testified to the contrary, that there is no evidence of Ukraine interference. Even before his July phone call pressing Ukraine\\'s president to investigate the theory, his own staff repeatedly told him it was \"completely debunked,\" Trump\\'s first homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, said in September. \"Fictions,\" a former senior director on the National Security Council for Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, testified Thursday. She told committee members: \"I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests\". TRUMP: \"I hardly know him, OK?\" — Fox interview Friday. TRUMP: \"I don\\'t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy, though. But I don\\'t know him well\". — remarks to reporters Wednesday. THE FACTS: That\\'s not credible. Testimony by several officials revealed that Sondland, Trump\\'s EU ambassador, was in frequent contact with Trump around the time Trump spoke with Zelenskiy about doing a politically beneficial \"favor\". Tim Morrison, the former NSC Russia and Europe senior director, who took over from Hill in July, told House investigators that Sondland and Trump had spoken approximately five times between July 15 and Sept. 11 — the weeks that $391 million in U.S. assistance was withheld from Ukraine before it was released as Trump pressed for the favor. Morrison said the ambassador \"related to me he was acting — he was discussing these matters with the president\". Sondland himself changed his testimony Wednesday to acknowledge more contacts with Trump than previously revealed. As recently as Oct. 8, Trump had tweeted that Sondland was a \"really good man and great American\". Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\\'s inaugural committee before being named the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. But Trump quickly became less familiar with his ambassador when Sondland testified that the president wanted a Ukrainian investigation of Democrats as a condition for his releasing U.S. military aid to that country. TRUMP: \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn\\'t care about American Workers!\" — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: Neither happened. Trump visited a factory in Austin, Texas, that has made the Mac Pro for Apple since 2013. Apple announced in September that it would continue having the Mac Pro line made in Austin, after the Trump administration agreed to waive tariffs on certain computer parts from China. It also plans to expand its already deeply rooted business in Austin and said Wednesday it has started construction of its new campus in the city. None of that equates to Trump\\'s false claim to have opened an Apple plant Wednesday. Meantime, the House worked into Wednesday evening, after Trump\\'s false tweet that Pelosi had shut Congress, and again Thursday before breaking for Thanksgiving week. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, Democratic chairman of the intelligence committee: \"I think the American people can be forgiven if they have the same impression, listening to some of the statements of my colleagues during this hearing, that Russia didn\\'t intervene in our election. It was all the Ukrainians\". — hearing Thursday. HILL: \"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps somehow for some reason Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves\". — hearing Thursday. REP. ELISE STEFANIK, Republican of New York: \"Not a single Republican member of this committee has said that Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections. To have our Democratic colleagues say these untruthful statements just reeks of political desperation\". — hearing Thursday. THE FACTS: Stefanik may be right that Republicans on the committee did not explicitly deny that Russia attacked the U.S. election. Yet Schiff and Hill may also be right in saying that Republicans left that impression at the hearings. Some Republicans on the committee repeatedly gave credence to the conspiracy theory that holds that Ukrainians actually hacked the Democratic National Committee emails, perhaps with a server that was in their country, and made it look as if Russia did it. To buy into this theory is to discount Russian culpability. A 2018 report by the then-Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee agreed with U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election, but disagreed with parts of the agencies\\' assessment that said Russia did so to help Trump. TRUMP: \"Right now you have a kangaroo court headed by little shifty Schiff, where we don\\'t have lawyers, we don\\'t have witnesses, we don\\'t have anything\". — Cabinet meeting Tuesday. THE FACTS: Depends on the meaning of \"we\". Republicans on the committee had a lawyer asking questions of the witnesses, so it\\'s not true that they had no legal representation. And several witnesses were invited at the request of Republicans on the committee. It\\'s also true, though, that Trump himself did not have a lawyer speaking for him at the hearings. That\\'s not unusual. The inquiry is meant to be a fact-finding process and the president is not charged with anything. He will have legal representation if the House Judiciary Committee moves ahead to draft articles of impeachment against him. BERNIE SANDERS: \"What the scientists are telling us is if we don\\'t get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we\\'re talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we\\'re talking about increased drought, we\\'re talking about increased extreme weather disturbances\". — Democratic debate Wednesday. THE FACTS: To be clear, the world\\'s big cities aren\\'t going to go underwater for good in as soon as eight to nine years. The Vermont senator\\'s reference to eight to nine years seems to refer to standard warnings of the expected temperature increases kicking in by roughly 2030, and the progressively worse weather extremes that will keep following. JOE BIDEN: \"The fact is the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: The former vice president\\'s statement is at odds with a Kaiser Family Foundation poll out this week. It found that 77% of Democrats support Medicare for All. Even more — 88% — support a \"public option\" proposal such as the one Biden advocates. It would allow people to buy into a new government insurance plan modeled on Medicare, but it would not completely replace private insurance. Overall, 53% of Americans support Medicare for All, while 43% oppose it, according to the Kaiser poll. It\\'s also true, though, that public support for Medicare for All declines when costs and other, similar details are introduced in the polling. ELIZABETH WARREN: \"Today in America — a new study came out — 20 years out, (of) whites who borrowed money, 94% have paid off their student loan debt, 5% of African Americans have paid it off\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: That\\'s not right. The Massachusetts senator appears to be citing a September report from Brandeis University\\'s Institute on Assets and Social Policy. The study found that, 20 years after starting college, 49% of white borrowers had paid off their loans entirely (not 94% of them) compared with 26% of black borrowers (not 5%). The study also found that the typical white student had paid off 94% of his or her debt, while the typical black borrower had only paid off 5%. Warren cited those statistics, but in the wrong way. She\\'s correct that there are disparities by race when it comes to paying back student loans. Other studies have similarly found that black borrowers are at greater risk of default than their white counterparts. TULSI GABBARD: \"The most recent example of inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels\". — Democratic debate. PETE BUTTIGIEG: \"That is outlandish, even by the standards of today\\'s politics. I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We\\'ve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\" — Democratic debate. GABBARD: \"You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was yes\". — Democratic debate. THE FACTS: Neither offered a fully accurate account in their exchange. Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman, did not accuse Buttigieg of being open to \"invading\" Mexico, as he suggested she did. But she did not explain the context of Buttigieg\\'s remarks at a Latino-issues forum in Los Angeles last Sunday. At the forum, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, heavily conditioned the idea of sending troops to help Mexico fight the drug and gang war, saying he would only do so if Mexico wanted the assistance as part of a security partnership. \"There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world,\" Buttigieg said in Los Angeles. \"I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this were necessary in order for us to uphold our treaty obligations. \"But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role if and only if it is welcome by our partner south of the border\".

Follow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck.BEIJING (AP) — Shares skidded Thursday in Asia after moderate declines on Wall Street as anxious mounted over the possibility the U.S. and China may not reach a trade deal before next year. Hong Kong led the region with its benchmark Hang Seng index falling 1.5% to 26,461.41. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.3% to 2,902.20, while Japan\\'s Nikkei 225 gave up 1.2% to 22,872.03. A published report suggested a preliminary \"Phase 1\" trade pact that President Donald Trump had said he hoped to sign this month may not be completed this year as negotiators continue to wrestle over differences. The report by Reuters cited an unnamed Trump administration official as saying it was possible a deal might not be reached, but more likely that it would. The comments spooked investors already twitchy over the possible blow to the talks from U.S. Congressional resolutions expressing support for human rights in Hong Kong, where political protests have dragged on for months. China condemned moves by U.S. lawmakers to throw their support behind the protesters in Hong Kong, threatening \"strong countermeasures\". \"Asia has been nervous about the state of trade play all week with equities ex-China underperforming. The early price action this morning suggests that the cautious walk to the exit may be turning into an unruly every man for himself,\" Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary. Investors have been hoping the world\\'s two biggest economies can make a deal before new and more damaging tariffs take effect Dec. 15 on about $160 billion in Chinese imports. Those duties would cover smartphones, laptops and other consumer goods. Beijing wants Washington to first agree to broader tariff rollbacks on Chinese goods. \"If a deal is not going to get done before the end of the year, then all of a sudden this uncertainty comes back in around what\\'s going to happen around December 15,\" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. \"Are the tariffs back on the table again? The market has certainly come to expect that those are not going to happen\". In other Asian trading, South Korea\\'s Kospi dropped 1.2% to 2,098.95 and the S&P ASX 200 lost 0.7% to 6,672.40. Shares fell across the region, but rose in India, where the Sensex gained 0.2% to 40,737.31. On Wall Street overnight, technology stocks took the heaviest losses, along with communication services and industrial stocks. Energy stocks notched big gains as crude oil prices rebounded. The selling nudged the major U.S. stock indexes off their recent all-time highs. The S&P 500 index dropped 0.4% to 3,108.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4% to 27,821.09, while the Nasdaq slid 0.5% to 8,526.73. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gave up 0.4% to 1,591.61. Growing optimism among investors that the U.S. and China were making progress toward a limited trade deal helped pave the way for gains in the market in recent weeks, including a string of all-time highs for the major stock indexes. That optimism dimmed Wednesday as investors weighed the implications of more tariffs kicking in next month. The two countries have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\\'s goods in the fight over China\\'s trade surplus and technology ambitions. That weighs on trade worldwide and threatens to depress corporate earnings and global economic growth, which has already showed signs of slowing. Benchmark crude oil shed 11 cents to $56.90 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose $1.66 on Wednesday to settle at $57.01 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gave up 15 cents to $62.25. The dollar slipped to 108.52 Japanese yen from 108.59 yen on Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.1077 from $1.1075.

Founded in 2012, Honey helps people find online coupons and discounts while they shop online. It has about 17 million monthly users. PayPal Inc. said Wednesday the acquisition will help its merchants attract new customers by offering personalized deals and offers. It says it also hopes to reach shoppers earlier, not just when they are paying at checkout. PayPal says Honey will keep its headquarters in Los Angeles and its co-founders will join PayPal, which is based in San Jose. The acquisition comes amid growing competition in the online payments market.For a few hundred dollars, tools and some elbow grease, you can make your own rifle or handgun. It\\'s all perfectly legal — and it can be done without leaving anything behind for the government to trace. These \"ghost guns\" have long been popular among hobbyists or gun enthusiasts. But gun control advocates say they are increasingly popping up in crimes, used by people who are prohibited from buying a firearm and are trying to circumvent a background check. \"Whatever the hobbyists think about it, criminals are taking advantage of this,\" said Nick Suplina, managing director for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group funded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \"These firearms directly undercut federal and state law designed to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\\'t have them,\" he added. Last week, a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban Los Angeles, authorities said. He shot himself and later died. He was too young to legally own a gun in California. It\\'s not immediately clear how he acquired the firearm — a.45-caliber, 1911-model replica pistol assembled from gun parts with no serial number. The boy\\'s father was described as an avid hunter who died two years ago. He had six registered guns, but officials found several other unregistered firearms in the home after the shooting and were working to determine their history. There are several ways to make your own firearm, some requiring more knowledge than others — from building each piece and then assembling it with the use of high-tech machines and tools to buying a kit online and assembling the gun with minimal machinery required. There also are some people who use a 3D printer to create the \"receiver\" — the essence of a firearm — that houses its critical components. Plenty of online companies sell what are called 80 percent receivers, which are nearly finished and require just a bit of drilling to be usable. They don\\'t have a serial number and don\\'t require a background check. There have even been so-called build parties — sometimes promoted on social media — where people construct firearms together. It\\'s legal to make your own firearm if it\\'s for your personal use and you don\\'t intend to sell it. For some in the gun rights community, it\\'s considered a constitutional right, part of the Second Amendment that gives Americans a right to possess a firearm. Some want the satisfaction of making something from scratch, while others are motivated by libertarian political beliefs and recoil at the government being able to keep tabs on whatever weapons they own. \"Why are we even having this question? If we have a right to make and bear arms, we have a right to make them,\" said Matthew Larosiere, director of legal policy at the Firearms Policy Coalition. Larosiere describes himself as a collector who has made quite a few of his own firearms over the years. He says such guns are rarely used in crimes and considers efforts to clamp down on their availability unfair to law-abiding gun owners, driven by false \"CSI\"-style fears of undetectable guns. \"Is it worth it to eviscerate a new technology and increase the size of our already massive criminal law just to assuage fear, fear with no actual backing in fact? I\\'d say, probably not,\" he said. Quite a few ghost guns have emerged in high-profile shootings in recent years in California, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Besides the shooting at the school in Santa Clarita last week, authorities found perpetrators of a 2014 bank robbery in Stockton had a homemade AK-47. The previous year, a man who killed five people on a college campus in Santa Monica had assembled an AR-15 after failing a background check at a gun dealer. Two years ago, a man who killed his wife and four others in Northern California had been prohibited from possessing a firearm because of a restraining order. He had handed over a 9 mm handgun but then made two rifles at home and used them in the attack. Tom Manger, a retired Maryland and Virginia police chief, said law enforcement is increasingly concerned about ghost guns popping up in crimes. Companies will sell parts online that don\\'t require a background check and cost several hundred dollars. \"Now, not only is it available, it\\'s easily available,\" he said. Manger has been at legislative hearings about measures to clamp down on gun parts and heard opponents saying they don\\'t want the government to know what weapons they own. \"As a cop, I\\'m telling you, I hear that, and I get a chill,\" he said. \"People want these guns because they want to be invisible to government and to law enforcement\". Though it\\'s become much easier to stay anonymous as technology has advanced, it\\'s not always cheaper. With sales for AR-platform rifles slumping, prices have dropped considerably, and it\\'s usually cheaper to buy one from a dealer than make one. But for some firearms, such as the Israeli Galil-style rifle, it might cost about $300 to buy the parts and more than $1,000 to buy one from a dealer. \"If you can use a drill, you can manufacturer a gun largely in 15 minutes,\" said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and now senior policy adviser for the Giffords gun control group. \"We\\'re far from the days of 20 years ago where if you don\\'t have a friend who has a machine shop, you can\\'t do this with tools you have in your home,\" he said. Pane reported from Boise, Idaho. Associated Press reporter Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says Iran is so \"unstable\" that the Iranian government has shut down the internet so Iranians cannot disclose what he says is the \"tremendous violence\" occurring in the country. Trump tweeted Thursday that the Iranian government wants \"ZERO transparency\" and believes that by shutting down the internet the rest of the world will not find out about the \"death and tragedy that the Iranian Regime is causing!\". Recent violence was triggered by Iran\\'s raising the minimum price for gasoline by 50%. The internet has been blocked since Saturday. Iran isn\\'t saying how many people have been killed, injured or arrested in the unrest. Amnesty International estimates at least 106 people have been killed with the actual death toll much higher.BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — One in ten of Louisiana\\'s 5,000 computer network servers that power operations across state government were damaged by this week\\'s cyberattack, a key technology official told lawmakers Friday. Neal Underwood, Louisiana\\'s deputy chief information officer, said the ransomware attack wasn\\'t catastrophic to state government. No data was lost, and no ransom was paid. But Underwood said the effect for some agencies was significant, particularly at the Office of Motor Vehicles, which shuttered its branch locations all week to repair its computer network. \"I can assure you that none of the actual data in our enterprise was inappropriately accessed,\" Underwood told the joint House and Senate budget committee. Technology staff has been working around the clock since the attack to get online systems and services back up and running. Underwood expects all state agencies to resume normal operations by Monday. In some instances, he said computer systems have to be rebuilt from the state\\'s backup and recovery systems. In addition to the 10% of network servers disrupted by the early Monday morning attack, Underwood said more than 1,500 of the state\\'s 30,000 computers were damaged. An investigation into the source of the cyberattack is ongoing. \"Who are the bad guys? Where are they from?\" asked Sen. Francis Thompson, a Democrat from Delhi. Underwood said the ransomware likely came from outside the United States. \"This was a sophisticated and coordinated attack,\" he said. \"This was not some malcontent teenager in their parents\\' basement\". The attackers had access to Louisiana\\'s government computer servers for \"a matter of hours\" before they were discovered, Underwood said. The Office of Technology Services immediately shut down external access to network servers when the breach was discovered. That caused a wider disruption of state government websites and email than the actual ransomware attack, Underwood said. John Bel Edwards planned to issue an emergency declaration Friday to ensure that people and businesses don\\'t face fines or penalties because of the cyberattack. For example, a driver won\\'t face a ticket if a driver\\'s license expired this week because the motor vehicle office locations weren\\'t open to renew that license. The ransomware attack happened just two days after statewide elections for governor, legislative seats and other positions around Louisiana. Sen. Mack \"Bodi\" White, a Republican from Central, questioned whether that could cause problems for certification of election results or changed numbers in election returns. \"It happened at a very inconvenient time,\" he said. \"A lot of the conspiracy theorists are calling me\". As White asked questions, Rep. Cameron Henry, the Jefferson Parish Republican who chairs the budget committee, received a text from Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin. Ardoin said the cyberattack caused \"no impact whatsoever\" to the election returns and results will be certified Tuesday as scheduled, Henry said. Sen. Sharon Hewitt, a Slidell Republican, praised the quick reaction from Louisiana\\'s technology services office. \"I do believe it could have been much worse,\" she said. Follow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte.NEW YORK (AP) — When Deb Fink heard about a company that could drive her 9-year-old son to his after-school program, she balked at the idea of putting him in a car with a stranger. But faced with the unrelenting pressure of driving him where he needed to go in the middle of her workday, she decided to give it a try. Now she is sold, and grateful for the handful of ride-hailing companies that have emerged at a time when children are expected to accomplish a dizzying array of extracurricular activities and the boundaries between work and home have blurred. The ride-hailing companies enable parents to summon a car — and in some cases childcare — for their little ones through smartphone apps. Among them are HopSkipDrive, Kango and Zum, hatched as startups primarily led by working moms as ride-hailing becomes a ubiquitous part of digital life. Together, the companies have driven more than 1.4 million children in 16,000 schools, primarily in California but with a growing presence in Colorado, Texas and Washington, D.C. Sara Schaer, cofounder and CEO of Kango, says her company wants to be a solution as soon as parents run up against the challenge of juggling work and family, rather than having them wait for their child to turn 6 or 7 or 8 when \"the damage is done\" and \"you\\'ve had to dial back on your career, you\\'ve not been able to enroll them in certain activities that you wanted to get them started early on, or you\\'ve had to move closer to where the day care is, or have limited your choices in that way\". The demand for such services has been so high in some places that companies struggle to provide enough drivers. Others face hurdles convincing parents that a stranger hired by a ride-hailing company is trustworthy enough to ferry their most precious passengers. They have distanced themselves from mainstream heavyweights Uber and Lyft, which have been hit by lawsuits accusing drivers of assaulting passengers. To allay concerns, companies catering to kids claim to screen drivers more extensively, checking their fingerprints and requiring them to have childcare or parenting experience, sometimes describing them as \"nannies on wheels\". Drivers and children are given passwords that must match, and parents can track a child\\'s whereabouts in real-time through the app. \"Every parent is going to be naturally skeptical, and we built it with that in mind,\" said Joanna McFarland, CEO and co-founder of HopSkipDrive, which operates in six states and Washington, D.C. \"As a parent, you may not know your child\\'s friends\\' parents or you may not know who the bus driver is. It\\'s really no different, but with this you have that tracking capability, and you know they\\'ve gone through that vetting process\". Fink\\'s son initially rode with another child when they started getting rides from HopSkipDrive, easing his discomfort about getting in the car with a stranger. \"We love it,\" said Fink, an educator in Berkeley, California. \"We had some issues with the driver giving the kids candy, or the driver not knowing the password, but for the most part I feel very comfortable and confident\". Zum, which operates in seven states, drives children aged 5 to 18 and HopSkipDrive serves ages 6 and up. Kango, which operates in California, will pick up babies, and they require that a caregiver accompany children under 2 years old. Unlike a babysitting arrangement, parents cannot interview candidates in advance or hire the same recurring driver using HopSkipDrive or Zum. On Kango, parents can \"meet and greet\" a driver before a ride and can request one or more to be the regular driver. If something does go wrong, many companies operating in the space require consumers to give up their right to file a lawsuit and to agree to arbitration or pre-arbitration mediation. In places where ride-hailing services for kids aren\\'t available, some parents have resorted to Uber and Lyft, even though drivers for those companies are not supposed to pick up solo passengers under 18. Megan Schade occasionally calls an Uber for her 14-year-old son, who she describes as street-savvy, with good intuition and an \"intimidating presence\". If she had a daughter, the Brooklyn mom said she most likely would not send her in an Uber. \"At least with the driving, you have a record of who\\'s driving your kid,\" Schade said. \"There\\'s a cyber trail\". Other parents said they wouldn\\'t take the risk. \"All it takes is one bad person who\\'s willing to risk their entire Uber career on hurting someone or kidnapping a kid,\" said Jeanne Solomon, a Brooklyn mom with a 14-year-old son. The stakes are even higher for companies that have built their business model around children. \"Even one sort of negative incident could sink a company, and so I think the care that these companies need to take to ensure that every ride is a good ride is much higher,\" said Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\\'s Stern School of Business and author of The Sharing Economy. Some ride-hailing services have linked up with schools — shuttling students to sports games and internships and replacing traditional buses — and that has helped them build credibility with parents. So far, most of the complaints against these types of companies seem to have more to do with quality of service than safety. While some parents praised them on Yelp for friendly, trustworthy drivers, others said drivers left children stranded, showed up 30 minutes late, canceled rides at the last minute or were frequently unavailable. Alpa Kohli was among the first parents to use Zum to send her sons to school, cutting her morning commute from about an hour-and-a-half to fifteen minutes. \"I honestly think that for working parents, time is money,\" said Kohli, a content developer at Microsoft. Not everyone can afford the services, however, and some companies have already raised prices. That could create an economic divide, where one socioeconomics class has access to a digital platform full of mobility options while another does not, said Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at U.C. In Fink\\'s case, the 2.5-mile ride costs $18 a day, more than she could normally afford. But the after-school program her child is enrolled in subsidizes the cost, she said. \"I would say it\\'s an elite service,\" Fink said. \"It\\'s something that people can only use sporadically, or if they use it regularly, they need to be pretty wealthy\".WASHINGTON, Nov. 25, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE). FTI Consulting, Inc. (NYSE: FCN) today released its 2019 U.S. Holiday Retail Forecast, which projects 5.2 percent growth in discretionary holiday spending and more promising prospects for retailers compared to the 2018 holiday season. While challenges to the U.S. retail sector remain, the economic backdrop entering this holiday season is much the same as it was a year ago, supporting the forecasted spending increase, according to FTI Consulting\\'s Retail & Consumer Products practice. The factors driving this growth include positively trending macroeconomic indicators, upbeat consumer sentiment, a resilient job market and tame inflation levels across the consumer sector. A positive distinction from last year may be the performance of financial markets, the forecast notes. A severe market selloff last December may have contributed to the weak season, which does not appear imminent this year. Similar to the 2018 retail forecast, sales growth will again disproportionately benefit online sellers. FTI Consulting\\'s Holiday Retail Forecast highlights that the online channel now commands nearly a 16 percent share of total retail sales and will continue to gain just over one percentage point of market share annually, or about $69 billion in retail sales that will move from store-based purchases to the online channel in 2019. FTI Consulting projects $185 billion of online retail sales in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 15 percent year-over-year from the fourth quarter of 2018. \"Not only is the online channel capturing a majority of total sales growth generally, but consumers tend to shop online even more than usual during the holiday season, with smoother ordering and delivery processes, leading to smaller Black Friday crowds and less concern of disappointment for last-minute shoppers,\" said J.D. Wichser, Leader of the Retail & Consumer Products practice at FTI Consulting. \"We\\'re seeing shorter checkout lines and easier return processes from store-based retailers as well – shoppers continue to win as retailers make every effort to accommodate their many whims by offering a myriad of shopper-focused conveniences\". The report highlights that with total retail sales growing at about 4 percent annually, the movement of sales from stores to online is the equivalent of approximately 50 percent of the industry\\'s total annual sales growth. While the holiday season continues to be important, the retail sector is in the midst of a profound transition that it must confront year-round. The money spent during the holiday season is increasingly concentrated with fewer retailers, making prosperity less shared and the aggregate success of the season less connected to the outcomes for many players. Moreover, this season retailers will have to contend with Amazon\\'s free one-day delivery for Prime members, a new benefit that proved to be popular with Amazon shoppers in the third quarter. \"The shorter holiday season this year given the late Thanksgiving should be of little or no consequence with respect to the season\\'s overall performance, but it will shift some holiday sales from November to December,\" said Christa Hart, a Senior Managing Director in the Retail & Consumer Products practice at FTI Consulting. \"We have long believed that shoppers have relatively fixed lists of gift recipients, and those lists get tackled regardless of when the season officially begins. The prospect of a strong holiday season, however, is greater because we\\'re comparing it against a particularly weak 2018, especially last December\".

VPR Brands, LP ( OTCQB: VPRB ): VPR Brands is a market leader and pioneer in electronic cigarettes and vaporizers for nicotine, cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD). Its patented technology is one of the original filed electronic cigarette patents dating back to 2009 and includes two broad, independent claims covering electronic cigarette products containing an electric airflow sensor, including a sensor comprised of a diaphragm microphone. The sensor turns the battery on and off, and covers auto-draw, buttonless e-cigarettes, cigalikes and vaporizers using an airflow sensor. Our technology is covered under electronic cigarette utility patent US 8205622. The company has recently hired a boutique Intellectual property law firm; SRIPLAW who will advise the company on monetization strategy and manage and execute the process. VPR Brands has started to identify well over 50 of the leading infringing companies, based on sales volume and notifying the companies of their infringement. The company\\'s monetization strategy includes licensing and or manufacturing contracts with infringing brand owners. The company and its legal team headed by Joel B Rothman of SRIPLAW are also prepared to litigate if necessary. \"Having personally been in the vape industry for the past 10 years and witnessing the evolution of ecig and vapor technology, it is befitting that our company owns this US utility patent for what has grown to be a multibillion-dollar market. The inner construction of an e-cigarette is quite simple and fairly standard and it is very obvious as to what our auto draw technology patent covers, and potential infringement is rather clear when you see it,\" said Kevin Frija, CEO of VPR Brands. \"Our Patent could be a huge windfall for the company either by enticing infringing companies to order product through VPR Brands or as an alternative pay royalty on infringing product. Infringement can be avoided by simply adding a button to the battery but there is a reason the preferred option by consumers and most manufactures to date to simulate real smoking is our buttonless auto draw technology which best mimics real smoking\". The company may also seek a buyer for this patent in the future. As an example of past patent sales for Electronic cigarettes, another company, Ruyan, gained a U.S. patent for its product with the application stating that the product is \"an electronic atomization cigarette that functions as substitutes (sic) for quitting smoking and cigarette substitutes\". (U.S. Patent No. 8,490,628 B2, 2013). In August 2013, Imperial Tobacco Group purchased the intellectual property behind the Ruyan e-cigarette for $75 million. The market was barely what it is today and has grown tremendously since 2013, nearly tripled in size. About VPR Brands, LP: VPR Brands is a technology company, whose assets include issued U.S. and Chinese patents for atomization related products including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components. The company is also engaged in product development for the vapor or vaping market, including e-liquids, vaporizers and electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes) which are devices which deliver nicotine and or cannabis through atomization or vaping, and without smoke and other chemical constituents typically found in traditional products.

Editor@NetworkWire.com.ATLANTA, Nov. 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/. Lectra announces the launch of two new solutions for the mass production of fabric car seats and interiors: Vector® Automotive iP6 and iP9. The latest additions to the already-extensive Vector Automotive range combine breakthrough cutting equipment innovation with an optimized software application and specially designed consumables to enable automotive suppliers to achieve zero-buffer cutting on a very wide variety of automotive materials. Lectra\\'s R&D teams devoted three years to developing the technology required for zero-buffer cutting. Improvements in hardware components, an updated equipment pilot with a powerful new algorithm, and a specially designed blade will enable automotive suppliers to achieve hundreds of thousands of dollars in material savings annually as compared to other solutions available on the market. Lectra developed the Vector Automotive iP series in direct response to the cost challenges faced by its automotive customers. Pressure from car manufacturers as well as rising manufacturing costs are driving automotive suppliers to constantly search for ways to cut costs. Material consumption is a particular area of concern, as this is the most significant expense in automotive car seat and interior manufacturing. With Vector Automotive iP6 and iP9, automotive suppliers will be able to achieve critical savings while minimizing the impact on their margins. Constant, real-time control of the cutting equipment is integral to Vector Automotive iP6 and iP9′s ultraprecise cutting. Sensors on the cutting-head camera detect stress and instantly adapt cutting parameters. The new algorithm, an add-on to the equipment software pilot, manages common lines in real time for the greatest degree of accuracy possible while cutting parameters are continually adjusted to the blade\\'s dimensions. In addition to substantially reducing material consumption, automotive customers will also benefit from lower consumable replacement costs and increased cutting time. Just as with materials, the new solutions enable an equivalent gain in paper and plastic films for each 1 mm reduction in buffer. Improvements in the bristle block, sharpening band and blade lifespans reduce maintenance time by half thereby drastically increasing machine availability. Both solutions come with Vector Dashboard, a cloud-based application that allows users to monitor each equipment through daily key performance indicators. Thanks to centralized data, customers can identify key areas of improvement, focus on value-added activities and speed up the decision-making process. \"Lectra takes its commitment to being a trusted partner of the automotive industry very seriously. Our ongoing research investments are key in allowing us to develop sophisticated solutions that respond to our customers\\' challenges, support their continuous improvement initiatives and help them improve their operational excellence. By enriching the Vector range with Vector Automotive iP6 and iP9, we provide our customers with the technology and expertise that will help them keep up with their customers\\' needs,\" explains Céline Choussy, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Lectra.
